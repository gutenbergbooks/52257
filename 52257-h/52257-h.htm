<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">UNCLE DANIEL'S OFFER</p></div>


<p class="p2">Sarah Wenner, who was fifteen years old,
but who did not look more than twelve,
hesitated in the doorway between the kitchen
and the best room, a great tray of tumblers
and cups in her hands.</p>

<p>"Those knives and forks we keep always
in here, Aunt Mena. We do not use them
for every day."</p>

<p>Her aunt, Mena Illick, lifted the knives
from the drawer where she had laid them.
One could see from her snapping black eyes
that she did not enjoy being directed by
Sarah. But order was order, and no one ever
justly accused a Pennsylvania German housewife
of not putting things where they belonged.
She laid the knives on the table for
Sarah to put away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>The kitchen seemed strangely lonely and
empty that evening, in spite of the number
of persons who were there.</p>

<p>Besides little Sarah, who was the head of
the Wenner household, now that the father
was dead and the oldest son had gone away,
and her Aunt Mena, who had driven thither
for the funeral that afternoon, there was
an uncle, Daniel Swartz, and his wife Eliza,
who was just then wringing out the tea-towels
from a pan of scalding suds, and the
Swartzes' hired man, Jacob Kalb, short and
stout, with a smooth-shaven face and tiny
black eyes.</p>

<p>Daniel Swartz sat beside the wide table,
the hired man by his side. On chairs against
the wall, sitting now upright, now leaning
against each other when sleep overpowered
them, were the Wenner twins, Louisa Ellen
and Ellen Louisa, whose combination of excessive
slenderness and appearance of good
health could be due only to constant activity.
In their waking moments they looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
not unlike eager little grasshoppers, ready
for a spring.</p>

<p>The last member of the party lay peacefully
sleeping on the deep settle before the
fireplace. His wide blue eyes were closed,
his chubby arms thrown above his head.
Worn with the excitement of the day, too
young to realize that the cheerful, merry
father whom they had carried away that afternoon
would never return, he slept on, the
only one entirely at ease.</p>

<p>Daniel Swartz rose every few minutes to
cover him more thoroughly. Aunt 'Liza and
Aunt Mena watched Uncle Daniel, the eyes
of the twins rested with scornful disfavor
upon Jacob Kalb, and Sarah watched them
all. Her tired eyes widened with apprehension
when she saw her uncle bend over Albert
as if he were his own, and she bit her
lips when she saw Aunt 'Liza and Aunt
Mena whispering together. Returning with
the empty tray, she moved swiftly across the
kitchen to where the twins were sitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment they were awake and engaged
in their favorite pastime of teasing
Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>Jacob had an intense desire to be considered
English, and in an unfortunate moment
had translated his name, not realizing how
much worse its English equivalent, "Calf,"
would sound to English ears than the uncomprehended
German "Kalb." It was the
twins' older brother, William, who had now
been away from home so long that they
had almost forgotten him, who had heard
Jacob telling his new name to some strangers.</p>

<p>"Ach, no, I cannot speak German very
good. I am not German. My name is Jacob
Calf."</p>

<p>He saw in their faces that he had made a
mistake, but it was too late to retract. Besides,
William Wenner, whom he hated, and
who had been to the Normal School, had
heard, and as long as Jacob lived the name
would cling to him. Ellen Louisa and Louisa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Ellen, accustomed to shout it at him from
a safe vantage-ground on their own side
of the fence, called it softly now when the
older people were talking, "Jacob Calf!
Jacob Calf!"</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, each twin found her arm
clutched as though in a vise.</p>

<p>"Ellen Louisa and Louisa Ellen, be still.
Not a word! Not a word!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" began the twins together. Sarah
had always aided and abetted them. It
was Sarah who had invented such brilliant
rhymes as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Jacob Calf,</div>
      <div class="verse">You make me laugh."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sarah's nonsense had amused the father and
delighted the children for many weary months.
Why had she suddenly become so strange
and solemn? To the twins death had as yet
no very terrible meaning, and they knew
nothing of care and responsibility. Each
jerked her arm irritably away from Sarah's
hand. Why didn't she tell the aunts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
uncle to go home and let them go to bed?
And why was Jacob Kalb there in the
kitchen? Why&mdash;But the twins were too
drowsy to worry very long. Leaning comfortably
against each other, they fell asleep
once more.</p>

<p>Sarah continued her journey across the
room to gather up a pile of plates. She sympathized
thoroughly with the twins in their
hatred for the hired man. He had no business
there. If the uncle and aunts wished
to discuss their plans, they should do it
alone, and not in the presence of this
outsider. But he knew all Uncle Daniel's
affairs, and was now too important a person
to be teased.</p>

<p>Sarah put the plates into the corner-cupboard,
arranging them in their accustomed
places along the back. She had seen Aunt
Eliza's and Aunt Mena's eyes glitter as they
washed them.</p>

<p>"It ain't one of them even a little bit
cracked," said Aunt 'Liza. "They should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
have gone all along to pop and not to Ellie
Wenner."</p>

<p>"And the homespun shall come to me,"
said Aunt Mena.</p>

<p>Sarah had been ready with a sharp reply,
but had checked it on her lips. "Pop" and
Aunt Mena, indeed! She thought of their
well-stocked houses. Her mother had had
few enough of the family treasures.</p>

<p>She stopped for a moment to wipe her
eyes before she went back to the kitchen,
standing by the window and looking out
over the dark fields. There was no lingering
sunset glow to brighten the sky, but Sarah's
eyes seemed to pierce the gloom, as though
she would follow the sun to that distant country
where her brother had vanished.</p>

<p>Two hundred years before, their ancestors
had come from the Fatherland, and ever
since, adventurous souls had insisted upon
leaving this safe haven to penetrate still
farther into the enchanted West. Whole
families had gone; in Ohio were towns and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
counties whose people bore the familiar Pennsylvania
German names, Yeager, Miller,
Wagner, Swartz, Schwenk, Gaumer. Dozens
of young men had gone to California in '49.
Some had returned, some were never heard
of again. Fifty years later, the rumor of gold
drew young men away once more, this time
into the bitter cold of the far Northwest.</p>

<p>William's indulgent father had let him
go almost without a word of objection.
He knew what <i>wanderlust</i> was. And for
some reason William had seemed suddenly
to become unhappy. The farm was small,
too small to support them all; there were
four younger children, and William, to his
father's and mother's secret delight, had declined
his Uncle Daniel's offer of adoption.
They had let him take his choice between
the straitened, simple life at home and the
prospect of ease and wealth at Uncle Daniel's.</p>

<p>Uncle Daniel had never forgiven them or
him. William's success at the Normal School,
where, with great sacrifice, he was sent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
irritated him; William's election as a township
school director made him furious.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that Daniel Swartz and
Jacob Kalb were the only persons in Upper
Shamrock township who did not like William.
Even Miss Miflin, the pretty school-teacher,
went riding with him in his buggy,
and all the farmers and the farmers' wives
were fond of him.</p>

<p>"His learning doesn't spoil him," said
Mrs. Ebert, who lived on the next farm. "He
is just so nice and common as when he went
away."</p>

<p>And then he had gone away again, not to
the Normal School, but to Alaska. Sarah
remembered dimly how he and his father
had pored over the old atlas after the twins
had been put, protesting, to bed, and the
mother had sat with Albert in her arms, and,
when the men were not watching her, with
a sad, frightened look in her eyes. Sarah
could understand both her brother's eagerness
and her mother's sadness. Little did any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of them foresee what the next few years were
to bring. The little mother went first, with
messages for William on her last breath, and
now the dear, cheerful father. Surely, if
William could have guessed, he would never
have gone so far away.</p>

<p>But for two years they had had no word.
At first there had been frequent letters.
When he reached Seattle, it had been too late
for him to go north, and he waited for spring.
Then it was difficult to get passage, and there
was another delay. After that the letters
grew fewer and fewer, and finally ceased.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a strange shadow had crept
over William's name and William's memory.
Pretty Miss Miflin asked no more about him,
Uncle Daniel came and spoke sharply to
Sarah's father and mother and then they
talked about him in whispers when they
thought Sarah did not hear. Once she caught
an unguarded sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have written again. If he does not
answer, he is dishonest or&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" her mother had answered sharply.
"No! William will come home, and then
he will tell us!"</p>

<p>But William had neither come nor written.
So far as they knew he had not heard of his
mother's death, and there was no telling
whether the announcement of his father's
death would reach him. Perhaps he, too,
might be&mdash;</p>

<p>But that thought Sarah would not admit
for the fragment of a second to her burdened
mind. She wiped away her tears once
more, and then she almost succeeded in smiling.
The black clouds in the west were parting.
Here and there a star peeped through.
She knew a few of them by name. There
was Venus,&mdash;Sarah, whose English was none
of the best, would have called it "Wenus,"&mdash;her
father had loved it. Often he had
watched it from this window. Perhaps William
saw it, too, in that mysterious night in
which he lived. Ah, what tales there would
be to tell when William came home!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Her father's death had meant the giving
up of all Sarah's dreams and hopes. Three
years before, they had driven one day to
a neighboring town. Drives were not frequent
in that busy household. Sarah remembered
yet how fine Dan and Bill had
looked in their newly blackened harness, and
how proud she had felt, sitting with her
father on the front seat.</p>

<p>They had seen many wonderful things: a
paint-mill, a low, long building, covered, inside
and out, with thick layers of red powder;
and the ore mines, great holes in the
yellow soil, where the ore needed only to be
dug out from the surface; and they had
stopped to watch a cast at a blast-furnace.
But most wonderful of all was the "Normal."
Sarah had seen the slender tower of
the main building against the sky.</p>

<p>"What is then that?" she had asked.</p>

<p>"That is the Normal, where William went
to school."</p>

<p>"Ach, yes, of course!" cried Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>All the delightful things in the world
were connected with William. Her father
looked down at the sparkling eyes in the
eager little face. He had had little education
himself, but he knew its value.</p>

<p>"Would you like, then, to come here to
school?"</p>

<p>Sarah's face grew a deep crimson. She
looked at the trees, the wide lawns, the
young people at play in the tennis-courts.</p>

<p>"I? To school? Here?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Wouldn't you like to be such
a teacher like Miss Miflin?"</p>

<p>Sarah's face grew almost white. It was as
though he had said, "Would you like to be
President of the United States?"</p>

<p>"<i>I!</i> Like Miss Miflin! Ach, pop, do you
surely mean it? But I am too dumb."</p>

<p>Her father laughed.</p>

<p>"No, you are not dumb. If you are good,
and if you study, you dare come here."</p>

<p>Ah, but how could one study with a sick
mother, and then a sick father and a baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to look after, and twins like Ellen Louisa
and Louisa Ellen to bring up, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Sarah went slowly back to the kitchen. It
was like going into church, all was so still
and solemn. Albert and the twins slept,
Aunt 'Liza and Aunt Mena had taken their
places on the opposite side of the table from
Uncle Daniel and Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>"Come, come," cried Uncle Daniel impatiently.
He did not like black-eyed little
Sarah. She looked too much like her father,
whom his sister had married against his will.
"We must get this fixed up. Sit down,
once."</p>

<p>Sarah sat down on the nearest seat, which
was the lower end of the settle on which
Albert lay. She wiped her hot face on her
gingham apron, then laid her hand on Albert's
stubby little shoes, as though she
needed something to hold to.</p>

<p>"Don't," commanded Uncle Daniel.
"You wake him up if you don't look a little
out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah's eyes flashed. As though she
would wake him, her own baby, whom she
had tended for three years! She wanted to
tell them to go, to leave her alone with her
children. But again she was wisely silent.
She did not know yet what it was that her
uncle meant to "fix up."</p>

<p>Swartz pulled his chair a little closer to
the table. He looked uncomfortable in his
black suit and his stiff collar. Occasionally
he slipped his finger behind it and pulled it
away from his throat, as though it were too
tight. It seemed as if his remarks were for
the benefit of Sarah alone, even though he
did not look at her, for Aunt Mena and
Aunt 'Liza and the hired man helped him
out with an occasional word as if they knew
beforehand what he meant to say.</p>

<p>He, too, had his dreams. One was to see
a son in his house; another was to see the
Wenner farm once more united to his own
as it had been in his father's lifetime. Then
he would have the old border on the creek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
There was also talk of the strange, new
"electricity cars" running along the creek.
That would double the value of the farm.</p>

<p>But he said nothing of this in his speech
to Sarah.</p>

<p>"A couple of years back," he began, "I
made an offer to Wenner. I said to him,
'I will take William and bring him up right,
and then he can have the farm when I am
no longer here.' That is what I said to your
pop. But he wouldn't have it. He had to
send William instead to school."</p>

<p>"Then what did he get for his schooling?"
asked Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>"I never had no schooling," said Uncle
Daniel. "And you see where I am. Nobody
needs schooling but preachers and teachers."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in schooling," said Aunt
Eliza.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Aunt Mena.</p>

<p>Sarah's eyes continued to flash, but she
said nothing. She knew that they were expressing
their scorn for her father's judg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ment,
but she was too tired to answer. If
they would only go home! She saw her
uncle look at little Albert. He need not
think she would give him up. Sarah almost
laughed at the idea. Then she heard that
her uncle had begun to speak again.</p>

<p>"Well, now I have another offer to make.
Mena will take Ellie and Weezy. I will take
Albert. He shall be Albert Swartz from now
on. And Sarah can come also to us to help
to work."</p>

<p>"You will have to be a good little girl
and work right," admonished Aunt 'Liza.</p>

<p>"And you will have a good home," put in
Jacob Kalb. "You and the zwillings (twins)."
There were times when Jacob's English vocabulary
was not equal to the demands upon it.</p>

<p>Sarah's pale cheeks grew a little whiter.
But Uncle Daniel had said it was an <i>offer</i>.
An offer could be declined.</p>

<p>"But we are all going to stay here together
like always," she said. "I and Albert
and the twins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>She saw their anger in their faces.</p>

<p>"What!" said Aunt Eliza.</p>

<p>"Such dumb talk!" cried Uncle Daniel.</p>

<p>"Are you then out of your mind?"
asked Aunt Mena.</p>

<p>Jacob Kalb alone said nothing. But Sarah
saw him smile. He planned to live in the
Wenner farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Will you plough?" demanded Uncle
Daniel.</p>

<p>"Or plant the seeds?" asked Aunt 'Liza.</p>

<p>"Or harvest?" said Aunt Mena.</p>

<p>Sarah spoke quietly. "I have it all
planned. Ebert will farm like always for the
half."</p>

<p>"The half!" repeated Uncle Daniel.
"Should we then give this good money to
Ebert? The half! I will farm."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Sarah. "But you
must pay the half to us because we must
live."</p>

<p>"Pay the half to you!" exclaimed Aunt
Mena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is our farm," replied Sarah. "It was
my mom's and my pop's farm. It isn't yours."</p>

<p>"Well, it will be mine," said Uncle Daniel.
"What would such children make with such
a farm?"</p>

<p>"I am not a child," answered Sarah firmly.
"For three years already I managed the
farm while my pop was sick. And it is William's
farm so much as ours. And when
William comes home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"William will never come home," said
Uncle Daniel.</p>

<p>Sarah got up from the old settle.</p>

<p>"William <i>will</i> come home!" she cried.
"It don't make nothing out if you do give us
homes. If you take the farm, it will be stealing."</p>

<p>"<i>Ei yi!</i>" reproved Aunt Mena shortly.
"That is no word for little girls!"</p>

<p>"A whipping would be good for her," offered
Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>"You haven't any right here, Jacob
C-calf," cried Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Jacob's little eyes narrowed. "It is no
way for little girls to talk when their brothers
steal school-board money, and go off
and their pops have to pay it," he said.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, then a
reproving murmur from Aunt Mena.</p>

<p>"It isn't true!" cried Sarah. "It isn't
true!" Suddenly she remembered her father's
sadness, her mother's tears.</p>

<p>She burst into wild crying. "Ach, I wish
you would go away and leave me with my
children! I will get good along, if you will
only let me be. Albert should be this long
time in his bed. I wish you would go home."</p>

<p>She bent to lift the sleeping child. But
her uncle pushed her aside.</p>

<p>"Albert is coming home with me," he
said, as he lifted him up. "Jacob, put
Weezy and Ellie in the carriage with Aunt
Mena."</p>

<p>Sarah tried to keep her hold of the little
boy. But she struggled in vain. Jacob Kalb
picked up one of the twins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ellen Louisa!" called Sarah.</p>

<p>Ellen Louisa struggled into wakefulness.</p>

<p>"Let me down, Jacob Calf; let me down!"
She began to cry. "Ja-cob Calf, you
m-make m-me l-laugh; let me down!"</p>

<p>But Ellen Louisa was borne shrieking
from the room.</p>

<p>"Louisa Ellen!" called Sarah.</p>

<p>But Louisa Ellen found herself closely held
by Aunt 'Liza and Aunt Mena, and she, too,
was led forth.</p>

<p>"You are <i>thieves</i>!" cried Sarah wildly.</p>

<p>"Be still," commanded Uncle Daniel.
"Will you wake him up?"</p>

<p>Then he, too, went toward the door. Aunt
'Liza put in her round face. They did not
mean to be cruel. But little Sarah must be
taught to know her place.</p>

<p>"Come, Sarah."</p>

<p>"I am going to stay here," said Sarah.
She stood in the middle of the room, a wild,
pathetic little figure.</p>

<p>"Come on," commanded Uncle Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to stay here," said Sarah.</p>

<p>At that moment Jacob Kalb returned.
The poor twins had, despite their rage, fallen
immediately asleep in Aunt Mena's carriage.</p>

<p>"Let her stay," he advised. "She will get
pretty soon tired of it when she is afraid in
the middle of the night."</p>

<p>"Ach, no!" cried Aunt Eliza. "She
can't stay here."</p>

<p>But Uncle Daniel decided to take Jacob's
advice.</p>

<p>"Come on, 'Lizie," he said.</p>

<p>For a moment after they had gone, Sarah
stared about her. Afraid! Here in her own
house with all the dear, familiar things of
every day! There was nothing to be afraid
of. She stood with blinking eyes, trying to
remember what they had said about William;
but her mind was a blank. She knew
only one thing,&mdash;if she did not go upstairs,
she should fall asleep where she stood.</p>

<p>She barred the doors and was about to
put out the light, when she saw, above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the mantel-shelf, the one firearm which
the Wenners possessed,&mdash;an old shot-gun,
which William had broken years ago, shooting
crows. Still half asleep, she lifted it
down, and put out the light. Then, dragging
it by the muzzle in a position which
would have been extremely dangerous had
the poor old thing been loaded or capable
of shooting, she took her candle and went
upstairs.</p>

<p class="center">THE REBELS TAKE TO ARMS</p></div>


<p class="p2">When Sarah woke at six o'clock the next
morning, the faint gray of the winter sunrise
was in the sky. She opened her eyes
drowsily, trying to account for the heavy
depression which seemed to weigh her down.
Then, when her outstretched arms found no
sturdy little figure beside her, and a glance
across the room showed the smooth, unopened
trundle-bed, she remembered suddenly
all that had happened on that sad
yesterday. Her father was gone, and Albert
and the twins, and there was no telling how
long she would be allowed to stay in the
farmhouse. She realized how impossible it
would be for a little girl&mdash;in the gray dawn
Sarah felt very small and young&mdash;to hold
out long against so determined a man as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Daniel Swartz. She turned her face deeper
into the pillow.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a soft sound recalled her
to herself. It was the whinnying of Dan
and Bill, calling for their breakfast, already
long overdue. And the cows must be fed
and milked, and the chickens must have
their warm mash. Sarah was upon her feet
in an instant. She was not quite alone so
long as these helpless creatures depended
upon her.</p>

<p>An hour later, she drove out of the yard
on her way to the creamery. With activity,
ambition had returned; she began even to
hope that her uncle might be persuaded to
let her stay. The sun had risen clear and
bright, and all the cheerfulness of Sarah's
disposition responded to it.</p>

<p>She wondered, as she drove along the
frozen roads, whether it would not be possible
to add a third cow to her dairy. And
she could keep more chickens. Her father
had taught her how to look after them,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>their
hens always laid better than Aunt
Eliza's. And if the chickens did well, and if
Ebert would put out the crops for her,&mdash;poor
Sarah meant to go ahead just as though
her uncle had not said that he would farm,&mdash;and
if the children were allowed to come
back, and then if William came home&mdash;She
knew in the bottom of her heart that they
were air castles, but she found them pleasant
abiding-places.</p>

<p>The men, waiting in line at the creamery,
called to her kindly, all but Jacob Kalb,
whose wagon was third from the delivery
door.</p>

<p>Henry Ebert was at that moment chirruping
to his horse to move into place before
the platform.</p>

<p>"Sarah!" he called. "Wait once. I move a
little piece back, and you can come in first."</p>

<p>Jacob Kalb approved of no such chivalrous
impulses.</p>

<p>"Those that come first should have first
place," he growled. "I can't wait all day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>But the men only laughed. None of them
liked Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>Sarah swung Dan into line before the door.
A week before, she would have called out,&mdash;</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Jacob Calf,</div>
      <div class="verse">He likes to <i>blaff</i>,"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"blaff" being the Pennsylvania German
word for bark, but now she sternly checked
her poetic fancies. Sarah had made up her
mind to be very wise and politic. But she
could not repress a smile of satisfaction over
her brilliant combination of Pennsylvania
German and English.</p>

<p>Jacob saw the smile and watched her,
scowling. It irritated him to see her there,
businesslike and cheerful, and it did not
give him any pleasure to hear a neighbor
call to her that he would stop for her milk-can
the next morning. Sarah shouted back
her thanks.</p>

<p>Ebert consented willingly to put out the
crops. He had a great admiration for smart
little Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Next week I begin to plough," he promised.</p>

<p>Then Sarah slapped the reins on Dan's
back and was off. There was plenty to do at
home: the house to put in order, several
hens to set, and some baking to be done. As
she drew near the farm, she became apprehensive.
Suppose her Uncle Daniel should
have taken possession while she was away!
She had locked the door, but the fastenings
of the windows were not very secure. And
to whom, in such a case, should she go?
Not to any of the farmers round about:
they were poor and had many children.</p>

<p>She could not take Uncle Daniel's charity,&mdash;she
knew that, no matter how hard she
worked, he would still consider it charity,&mdash;and
she could not live with Aunt Mena,
who had the twins. She thought vaguely of
going with her trouble to Miss Miflin. But
Miss Miflin had no home.</p>

<p>There was no sign of any alien presence
as she drove up the lane. The cat sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
comfortably on the doorstep, a sure sign
that there were no strangers about. Sarah
stopped thankfully to pat him before she
fitted the key into the lock.</p>

<p>"You poor Tommy, where would you go
if Sarah went away?"</p>

<p>Still talking to the cat, she pushed open the
door. Then she stood still, as though she
were turned to stone.</p>

<p>Within, all was confusion. She did not
see that it was the sort of confusion which
could be created in a few minutes and as
quickly straightened out. Immediately in
front of the door the old settle had been
turned over on its stately back, and the
chairs were piled high on the table in a sort
of barricade.</p>

<p>Sarah's first thought was of thieves. Then
she realized that she was looking straight
into the barrel of a shot-gun.</p>

<p>It made no difference that it was the same
broken gun which she had carried upstairs
with her the night before, and that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
knew it would not shoot. She was terrified
at first beyond the power of speech. She
leaned, weak and faint, against the door-post,
and presently demanded who was there.</p>

<p>Two voices answered her.</p>

<p>"Hands up!"</p>

<p>Then Sarah rushed forward.</p>

<p>"Ellen Louisa!" she cried. "Louisa
Ellen!"</p>

<p>The twins had been carried to Aunt
Mena's and put to bed without waking.
Then Aunt Mena had sat down before the
kitchen fire to explain to her husband why
she had brought them home.</p>

<p>"Daniel, he says I shall take them. He
takes the farm, and he will pay me each week
a dollar for Ellie and Weezy. He has to, or
I will not keep them. And I get my share
of pop's and mom's things what Ellie had,
too. They won't do these children no good.
But I will not manage Ellie and Weezy like
him. He is too cross. I will first tame them.
But he is not cross to Albert. Now these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
twins shall do for a few days what they want.
They dare go to school this year and next
yet, then they must stop."</p>

<p>In the morning Aunt Mena began her
process of taming, which would undoubtedly
have proved successful with persons more
amenable than the twins. In the first place,
she let them sleep as long as they liked.
When Ellen Louisa woke, she saw by the
century-old clock, ticking on the high chest
of drawers, that it was seven o'clock. She
nudged Louisa Ellen, who scrambled out of
bed.</p>

<p>"We must hurry or we will be late to&mdash;"
At that moment Louisa Ellen, instead of
rolling out of a low trundle-bed, fell with a
loud thump, from the high four-poster. She
realized that they were not at home. Then
upon them both dawned the recollection of the
night before, and the weary days before that.</p>

<p>"P-pop, he wouldn't like it that we were
here," said Louisa Ellen. "He said we
should stay always by Sarah."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Ellen Louisa did not answer, but began to
put on her shoes and stockings with lightning
speed. The twins never wasted many
words.</p>

<p>As soon as Aunt Mena heard them stirring
about, she came to the foot of the steps.</p>

<p>"Wee-zy," she called. "El-lie! Breakfast."</p>

<p>"Our names&mdash;" began Ellen Louisa
shrilly; then she was stopped by Louisa
Ellen's hand on her mouth.</p>

<p>"Don't make her mad over us," advised
Louisa Ellen. "She might pen us up."</p>

<p>"We will go to school," said Ellen Louisa.
"Then we will go home to dinner. Pop
wouldn't like it if we weren't in school."</p>

<p>But Aunt Mena did not approve.</p>

<p>"In a couple of days you shall go again
in the school. But you are not going any
more in the Spring Grove School. It is not
any more your district."</p>

<p>"N-not to Miss Miflin!" gasped Ellen
Louisa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you are no more in Miss Miflin's district."</p>

<p>"B-but&mdash;" Ellen Louisa felt her braid
of black hair sharply tweaked. Louisa Ellen
was a shade thinner than Ellen Louisa and
a trifle quicker witted.</p>

<p>"You didn't have to tell Aunt Mena right
out that we were going home," she said,
when they had finished their breakfast. "Now
come on."</p>

<p>The coast was, at that moment, perfectly
clear. Aunt Mena was in the cellar getting
the cream ready to churn, and Aunt Mena's
husband was in a distant field, ploughing.
The twins seized caps and shawls and fled.
Ellen Louisa made for the high road.</p>

<p>"What have you for!" cried Louisa Ellen.
"That way she will look for us. We go
this way to the Spring Grove road. Come
on."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, when Aunt Mena came
to the door, they were not in sight. Aunt
Mena was not much troubled. She did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
know that Sarah had been allowed to stay
in the farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Pooh! they will go to Daniel, and he
will fetch them home, or I will fetch them
home. It is all one."</p>

<p>And Aunt Mena went back to her work.</p>

<p>The twins had a ride in a farmer's cart,
which brought them to the foot of the lane.
Realizing that they were too late for school,
they decided to go home until the afternoon
session. Then Sarah would write a note of
explanation to Miss Miflin. To the twins
Sarah's notes were as all-powerful as Aladdin's
lamp. To Miss Miflin they were sources
of both mirth and grief. She laughed because
they were so irresistibly funny, and
then she almost cried because they reminded
her of plans and hopes once dear to her heart,
which had been ended forever by misunderstanding
and resentment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Teacher," Sarah wrote. "Please
excuse the zwillings" (there were times in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
stress of hasty composition when English
words eluded Sarah's grasp as they eluded
Jacob Kalb's) "for being late. They cannot
come now so early like always, while they
must help a little in the morning.</p>

<div class="sig">
Their father,<br />
<span class="smcap pl3">Sarah Wenner</span>."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Sarah considered that the signature was
a happy combination of the respect due to
fathers and the sign of her stewardship of
his affairs.</p>

<p>Sometimes Miss Miflin started to go to see
little Sarah, who had been the best and brightest
pupil she had ever had, but she never got
quite to the house. She blamed herself for
William's going away, and she thought that
they too might blame her. So she turned
back.</p>

<p>The twins had not been at all alarmed by
the closed house. Sarah always drove to the
creamery. They did not realize that Albert
had been taken away, and supposed that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
had gone with her, since they were not there
to look after him. Prying open the cellar
door, which was fastened by a loose bar that
could be moved from the outside, they were
soon in the house. They were wild with delight
over their escape.</p>

<p>"Let us get ready for Aunt Mena if she
comes," proposed Louisa Ellen. "Let us
built such a fort."</p>

<p>It was "such a fort" which had frightened Sarah.
Now the twins flung themselves
upon her. They had run off, they had come
home, they were not going to school till afternoon,
they&mdash;But where was Albert?</p>

<p>"He is by Uncle Daniel," answered Sarah
slowly.</p>

<p>"Then we will fetch him." The twins
made a dash for the door. But Sarah held
them back.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Uncle Daniel will keep
Albert by him. And perhaps Aunt Mena
will fetch you again, and perhaps Uncle
Daniel will take the farm away from us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and perhaps we cannot be any more together."</p>

<p>The twins were amazed and bewildered.
Sarah's solemnity worried them more than
the catalogue of evils.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" they asked.</p>

<p>"You can learn your lessons and say them
to me. And you can sew your patchwork
and be quiet and smart."</p>

<p>All the rest of the morning, and all the
afternoon, there was quiet such as the farmhouse
had never known when a twin was
within it and awake. Dinner was eaten almost
in silence, and then Sarah, locking the
door behind her, and with many long glances
over the fields and road, went out to feed
the stock.</p>

<p>She fancied that she saw a little face pressed
to the kitchen window of the Swartz farmhouse,
far away across the brown fields, but
she could not be sure. Albert was so little,
he had learned to be fond of Uncle Daniel,
who was constantly giving him presents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
candy and peanuts; it would be easy enough,
Sarah thought, for them to keep him there.</p>

<p>It was almost supper time, and the early
dusk was falling, when the twins were ready
to recite their lessons. It is safe to say that
never, even in Pennsylvania Germandom,
was there a class like this which Sarah held.
Fortunately the twins were good arithmeticians,
for Sarah could not have corrected their
mistakes; she had been too long away from
school for that. The twins never guessed
that, when she insisted upon a careful explanation
of each simple process, she was learning
from them.</p>

<p>They had not heard as yet Miss Miflin's
careful pronunciation of the words of the
spelling lesson; so when Sarah said "walley"
or "saw," they answered at once "v-a-l-l-e-y"
or "t-h-a-w," never dreaming that
Sarah's speech embodied all the mistakes
which Miss Miflin tried to correct.</p>

<p>When it came to the geography lesson,
Sarah shone. The twins had not had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
advantage of hearing their father and William
speculate about strange and distant
lands; they had a certain amount of book-knowledge,
but no imagination to enliven
it.</p>

<p>"How wide is the Amazon River at its
mouth?" asked Sarah.</p>

<p>"Two hundred miles," answered the twins
glibly.</p>

<p>"How wide is that?"</p>

<p>Louisa Ellen responded. To her a river
was a line on a map. She would make this
river wide enough even to suit Sarah.</p>

<p>"About as wide as the coal-bucket," answered
Louisa Ellen.</p>

<p>At that moment, before Sarah had time to
explain to Louisa Ellen the phenomenal dullness
of her mind, the latch of the door was
lifted softly and allowed to drop.</p>

<p>"It is Aunt Mena," said the twins together.</p>

<p>Sarah motioned them to the settle.</p>

<p>"Sit there till I tell you to get up," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
commanded. "I will go up to the window
and look down."</p>

<p>The twins held each other's hands in
fright. Was Jacob Kalb coming again to
carry them out?</p>

<p>"Aunt Mena couldn't fetch us alone,"
said Ellen Louisa.</p>

<p>Then they started up in fright, realizing
that Sarah was falling downstairs. She
righted herself immediately, at the bottom,
and rushed past them to fling wide the
door.</p>

<p>A tiny little figure stood without.</p>

<p>"I sought I would come once home," said
Albert. "So I runned off."</p>

<p>Speech suddenly became impossible, as
Albert found himself almost smothered under
a multitude of caresses. When they let
him go, he drew a sticky package from his
blouse.</p>

<p>"I brought some candy along for you,"
he said; whereupon he was almost smothered
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Never had the old farmhouse known more
happiness than filled it that night. Never
was waffle-batter so light or appetites so
good. Then, what games! Sarah was a
teacher, book in hand,&mdash;that was her favorite.
Then they were children lost in the
woods, and Sarah was a bear,&mdash;that was
the twins'.</p>

<p>No one but Sarah realized how strange it
was that they should be playing there so
contentedly. It seemed to her that a vast
space of time divided this day from yesterday.
It seemed almost as though her father
had come back, or as though William might
come in upon them. Little Sarah almost listened
for his step.</p>

<p>Then, like a warning to dream no more,
there came first an imperative lifting of the
latch, then a loud knock on the door.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Sarah.</p>

<p>"Albert is to come right aways home."
That was Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>"The twins are to come right out." That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
was Aunt Mena. For the first time in thirty
years Aunt Mena's butter had failed to
"get," and she was angry and impatient.
She had forgotten her gentle intention to
"tame" the twins. "Come right aways out,
or you will get a good whipping."</p>

<p>The twins looked critically at the strong
wall between them and the enemy. It seemed
a time when the dictates of wisdom might
yield to those of personal satisfaction.</p>

<p>"We won't," said Louisa Ellen.</p>

<p>"Jacob Calf!" called Ellen Louisa.</p>

<p>"Go upstairs and take Albert," commanded
Sarah. Then she turned to the door.
"You can't have my children."</p>

<p>"I give you a last chance," said Aunt
Mena. "I don't care for the dollar a week.
Shall the twins have a good home, or shall
they not have a good home?"</p>

<p>"You cannot have my children," said Sarah
again, her heart pounding like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>"Well, then," called Aunt Mena furiously,
as she went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Jacob Kalb lingered. If Mena Illick refused
to take the twins, Swartz might be
compelled to leave them all there. Then
Jacob could not have the house.</p>

<p>"You ought to be srashed!" he shouted
to Sarah. "You are a bad girl. You put
Albert out here."</p>

<p>Then Jacob began to pound on the door.</p>

<p>It was five minutes later when Sarah came
upstairs. Her face was white and her hands
shook. Yet she was laughing.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell him if he don't go
away you will shoot him with the gun?"
demanded Louisa Ellen.</p>

<p>Sarah laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>"That was just what I did tell him," she
said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">UNCLE DANIEL STEALS A MARCH</p></div>


<p class="p2">Stammering, frightened, shouting something
to Aunt Mena which she did not understand,
Jacob Kalb fled from the Wenner farmhouse
across the fields toward the Swartzes'. He
burst into the kitchen, where Aunt 'Liza was
putting the supper on the table, like a wild
man.</p>

<p>Aunt 'Liza was still explaining to her angry
husband how Albert got away.</p>

<p>"He was here, and then he wasn't here,"
she said almost tearfully. "And nobody was
here to go after him, and I didn't know what
to do, and&mdash;and I believe perhaps she came
after him."</p>

<p>Aunt 'Liza was willing to lay the blame of
Albert's escape almost anywhere but where
it belonged, on herself. Then she was fright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>ened
by the look of rage in Uncle Daniel's
face.</p>

<p>"Did you see <i>her</i> here after Albert?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I didn't <i>see</i> her here after him.
But I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thinking is now no good," answered Uncle
Daniel. Then he got upon his feet.
"There, they're coming. I can hear them."</p>

<p>Before he reached the door Jacob Kalb
burst in.</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;she will&mdash;she will sh-shoot me!"
he cried wildly. "She was going for to fetch
the shot-gun to shoot me!"</p>

<p>Aunt 'Liza threw herself against the door,
shutting it almost in Aunt Mena's face.</p>

<p>"Where are you shot, Jacob?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I am not yet shot," answered Jacob.
"But I will be shot. I&mdash;" He felt suddenly
his master's grip on his arm. "Ow! What is
the matter?"</p>

<p>"Where is Albert?" asked Uncle Daniel.
"She has no gun to shoot with. What are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
you talking about? Where is Albert, I
say?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't give him to me," gasped
Jacob. "They yelled at me, the zwillings
yelled at me. They wouldn't give him to
me. She is after me with a gun. She&mdash;"
There was suddenly a loud pounding at the
door. "I tell you she is after me. She&mdash;"</p>

<p>Uncle Daniel strode to the door, and flung it
wide. He, at least, was not afraid of being shot.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he shouted. Then
he saw that it was Aunt Mena who stood
without.</p>

<p>"I mean that if Ellie and Weezy don't
come along home with me to-night, they are
not to come at all," said Aunt Mena hotly.
"I cannot be running the whole time over
the country for them."</p>

<p>"Ellie and Weezy," repeated her brother.
"Are they not by you?"</p>

<p>"No, they ran early this morning off already."</p>

<p>"And Albert ran off," said Aunt 'Liza.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
"I could not help it. I went a little while on
the garret, and when I came back, he was
gone. I cannot help it. I&mdash;Where are you
then going, Daniel?"</p>

<p>Uncle Daniel cast a scornful glance at the
two women who could not keep three children,
one a mere baby, from running away, and at
the fright-stricken Jacob; then, regardless of
the hot supper, about which he was usually
so particular, he stalked out.</p>

<p>"Put Albert's high chair to the table," he
had ordered briefly.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes he was back. Aunt 'Liza
had not learned much tact in all her twenty
years of wedded life, or she would not have
begun to question him before he was inside
the door.</p>

<p>"Where is then Albert?" she asked.</p>

<p>Swartz did not deign to answer. With a
heavy frown, he sat down at the table and
began to eat.</p>

<p>"Didn't she give him to <i>you</i>?" demanded
Aunt Mena, aghast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be still," said Uncle Daniel shortly.</p>

<p>"Did she get after you with the gun?" asked
Jacob Kalb. He had just finished giving the
women an account of his adventure. He said
that he saw the gun-barrel when he looked
in the keyhole.</p>

<p>"Then she didn't come out after you?"
said Aunt Mena.</p>

<p>"No, but she <i>was</i> coming," insisted Jacob.
"I am going to have the law on her, that is
what I am going to do. I will have her put
in jail. I will have her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet," said Uncle Daniel to him, also.</p>

<p>Aunt Mena rose to go.</p>

<p>"I don't come again after Ellie and Weezy,
remember," she said. "If you fetch them
over, perhaps I will take them back. Just
tame Sarah a little&mdash;" She forgot that her
own efforts at taming had not been very successful.
"And then put somebody in the
house, so she cannot get back. That will settle
it."</p>

<p>"Be quiet," said Uncle Daniel again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will have the law on her," muttered
Jacob Kalb. Every few minutes he rubbed
his leg, as though he were feeling for a gunshot
wound.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes before Uncle Daniel
laid down his knife and fork and pushed
back his plate. Either reflection or the good
supper had soothed him. The angry flush
was dying out of his face.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do?" asked
Aunt 'Liza.</p>

<p>"I have it fixed," he answered complacently.</p>

<p>"Are you going to put her out of the
house?" asked Aunt 'Liza.</p>

<p>"Are you going to have the law on her?"
asked Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Uncle Daniel. "I am
going to put her out of the house, and I am
going to have the law on her. I am going to
do both of those things. I am going to be
the guardian of her and of Ellie and Weezy
and Albert."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guardian?" repeated Aunt Eliza.</p>

<p>"Yes, guardian. Those children must
have a guardian, and I am the one to be
it. But I must have papers. You cannot
be a guardian unless you have the papers
from the court. I will go to-morrow to town
and get papers. Everything shall be fixed
right."</p>

<p>Aunt Eliza was alarmed.</p>

<p>"But it will cost money!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," answered Uncle
Daniel. "It is a kindness I do these children.
Shall I pay for it, yet?"</p>

<p>"And then Sarah will <i>have</i> to come here?"</p>

<p>"Sarah will have to do what I say she
shall do," answered Uncle Daniel. "And
Albert and Ellie and Weezy. Everybody
will have to do what I say they shall do."</p>

<p>Jacob Kalb gazed at him with admiration
and delight. Daniel Swartz always found
some way of accomplishing what he wished.
It was true that he had not succeeded in
adopting William Wenner. But he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
succeeded in punishing William, only Jacob
knew how well.</p>

<p>If it had not been for that knowledge,
Jacob Kalb would not have been looking
forward with such delight to living in the
Wenner house, instead of walking back
and forth each night and morning to the
house of his wife's father, three miles away,
where he lived now.</p>

<p>He rose to go home, not at all certain that
Sarah was not waiting for him outside the
door with her shot-gun.</p>

<p>"In the morning you are to go early into
town with me," said Uncle Daniel. "At six
o'clock we will start."</p>

<p>"You ought to bring a little hat for
Albert," said Aunt 'Liza when the door was
closed.</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered her husband. "I
bring him perhaps a little candy or peanuts,
but no more. Not till he is here to stay. I
brought William sometimes presents, suits,
I brought him, and a little cap, and shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and once such a little velocipede, and what
did I get? No, sir. When Albert is here to
stay, then I get him some things."</p>

<p>When supper was over, he sat down before
the fire. He seemed to be brooding over
William's ingratitude.</p>

<p>"Shoes, I bought him, and candy. And
what did I get for it?"</p>

<p>Accompanied by Jacob Kalb, he reached
the county seat long before the earliest
lawyer was astir. It did not occur to him
that there was a difference in lawyers or
lawyers' prices. He had heard of Alexander
Weaver, so he went to him.</p>

<p>"This is a fine way," he said to Jacob
Kalb, when they had waited for half an hour.
"I'd like to know how my work would get
done if I fooled round this way in the early
morning; that is what I would like to know.
If he don't soon come, I go."</p>

<p>Then the door of Mr. Weaver's private
office opened, and Mr. Weaver himself invited
them in. He was a dear-eyed, middle-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>aged
man, so busy that he often offended his
clients by his curtness. He gave Daniel and
Jacob chairs where he could watch their
faces. He imagined from their appearance
that they had come about some country
quarrel. And country fees were hard to collect.</p>

<p>Uncle Daniel began slowly to state his
cause.</p>

<p>"My brother-in-law, he is dead," he announced.</p>

<p>"Yes?" The lawyer crossed his knees
nervously.</p>

<p>"And my sister, she is dead."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And it is nobody to look after their
things."</p>

<p>"Any children?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Minors?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"No, children."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean any under age, under
twenty-one?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is a couple. Sarah&mdash;" Uncle
Daniel counted them off on his fingers. The
lawyer's abrupt speech startled him, and he
was afraid he might forget.</p>

<p>"How old?"</p>

<p>"She is fifteen, but she is little. She
could not run a farm."</p>

<p>"But she thinks she can do everything,"
put in Jacob Kalb. "She got after me with
a gun."</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled. He did not take kindly
to Jacob Kalb, and it was amusing to think
of a fifteen-year-old girl "getting after" him
with a gun.</p>

<p>"Any others?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a couple of twins, Weezy and
Ellie."</p>

<p>"How old?"</p>

<p>"About ten. But they are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Any others?"</p>

<p>"Albert. He is four. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you want to be appointed guardian
of these minor children of your sister?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Uncle Daniel blinked. He
could not understand the phenomenal quickness
of this man's mind. For the next few
minutes he continued to blink rapidly.</p>

<p>"Your name? Your occupation? The
value of the property of these minors?"
Question followed question so fast that Uncle
Daniel could hardly think.</p>

<p>"You will have to sign a bond for the
amount of the property, you know. Your
application will be sent to the Orphans'
Court. Come back in a month. The retaining
fee will be twenty-five dollars."</p>

<p>Then Uncle Daniel got his breath.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars! Twenty-five dollars
for what?"</p>

<p>"For making application to the Orphans'
Court. Wasn't that what you wanted me to
do?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes, b-but twenty-five dollars for
writing out a couple of papers! Twenty&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lawyer swung round to his desk.
Daniel realized suddenly that the lawyer did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
not care whether he got the case or not.
He became all the more anxious to have this
remarkable man continue it. Sarah might in
some way make trouble.</p>

<p>"All right," he stammered. "We will
come in a month back again. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lawyer flung him a crumb of comfort.</p>

<p>"You will be reimbursed, of course, from
the estate," he said; and Uncle Daniel's face
brightened.</p>

<p>He did not realize that in thus putting
himself into the hands of the law, he would
place over his own actions a guardian to
whom he should some day have to give an
account of his stewardship. In Uncle Daniel's
mind, he was to be, after the month was
up, supreme arbiter of the fates of the Wenners,&mdash;Sarah
and Albert and the twins alike,
and of their property. He meant to be honest.
Even though he did take the farm, he
would support them, Sarah and Albert at
his own home, and the twins at Aunt Mena's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Only, if Sarah did not behave, she would
have to go out to work.</p>

<p>There was triumph in every motion of
Uncle Daniel's broad, heavy shoulders, as he
went down the steps. He had began to think
that education was a good thing for lawyers,
also. It must be pleasant to get twenty-five
dollars for writing a few words.</p>

<p>At a store at the corner, he bought five
cents' worth of peanuts and a small bag of
candy. Then they started home, drawing
rein first at the Ebert farm. Ebert appeared
in response to a loud hulloa. He wondered
why Swartz was stopping at his gate.</p>

<p>"When will you begin to plough for the
little one?" Uncle Daniel asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't plough at all," said
Uncle Daniel. "I am to be guardian, and
I will plough."</p>

<p>When they reached the lane which led to
the Wenner house, they saw Albert and the
twins playing in the yard. Swartz pulled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the horse with a jerk, then he jumped down
with the little bags in his hand.</p>

<p>"Tell 'Lizie that Albert will be home for
supper," he said.</p>

<p>This time he did not stride up to the
door and demand Albert. Instead he stole
down the lane to the back of the house. He
did not mean to take any actively offensive
measures till the end of the month.</p>

<p>Sarah was not able to tell afterwards how
Albert got away. She had kept the children
close beside her all the morning, and it was
not until afternoon that she yielded to their
pleadings to be allowed to go out of doors
to play. Then she sat down at the window
with some sewing in her hands, in order that
she might watch them.</p>

<p>She had not moved until the sudden hissing
of steam warned her that the water in
the kettle was boiling over. It had not taken
her a minute to move it to the back part
of the stove, but in that instant Albert was
gone. She could see them crossing the fields,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Albert in his uncle's arms. The twins ran
frantically behind them, and Sarah hurried
to the door.</p>

<p>"He coaxed him away with candy,"
wailed Louisa Ellen when they ran back.
"But Albert said he was coming home for
supper."</p>

<p>That night there were no games. The
doors were barred early, the supper eaten
silently. Then Sarah got pen and paper and
sat down beside the lamp. She would make
a last appeal to William. Perhaps, though
all the other letters had failed, this might
reach him, and reaching him, might touch
his heart.</p>

<p>It would have taken Sarah all night and
all the next day to say all that was in her
mind. But the task of composition was difficult
and the letter was short. It read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;My Uncle Daniel is
after us. He fetched Albert again. Jacob
Kalb wants to live here. The twins will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
stay by Aunt Mena. I am doing the best I
can. I wish you would come home. Uncle
Daniel will not have it that the twins and
Albert live in their right home. We are well
and hope you are the same.</p>

<div class="sig">
Resp. yours,<br />
<span class="smcap pl3">Sarah Wenner</span>.<br /></div>


<p>P.S. I chased Jacob Kalb off with the
gun, but I fear me that perhaps he will come
again.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was not a neat production, Sarah realized
that. She tried to wipe off a teardrop
which fell upon it, and made a tremendous
blot. And William had always been so particular
about the way she wrote. It did not
occur to her that, to the heart of an affectionate
brother, the pathetic blot would be
more eloquent than pages of pleading.</p>

<p>She addressed the letter to Seattle, then,
waking the twins, who had gone to sleep on
the settle, she sent them to bed.</p>

<p>Ah, that old settle, how many times it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
held them! What would Uncle Daniel have
done with that? He and Aunt Mena had
settles of their own. Would he have left it
there for Jacob Calf? And the dear, battered
furniture, the high chair which had
held them all, from William down to Albert,&mdash;would
he have sold them? It would be
like killing a live creature to break up that
home. Sarah gave up her own dreams cheerfully.
She thought no more of the "Normal."
If they could only stay together, she
would ask no more of fate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">THERE IS COMPANY TO SUPPER</p></div>


<p class="p2">Miss Miflin wondered day after day why
the Wenner twins did not come to school.
She knew that their father had died,&mdash;that
would account for three or four days, but
why had they not come back after the funeral?</p>

<p>It was true that their absence made Miss
Miflin's life much easier. They were not only
very active themselves, but they were able to
incite the best-behaved of schools to mischief.
When Miss Miflin heard confusion behind
her as she put a problem on the board, she
needed only to call out, "Ellen Louisa!"
and then "Louisa Ellen!" and the noise
ceased.</p>

<p>When they were approached in private,
the twins were as shy as rabbits. They stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
twisting their aprons and looking at each
other as though Miss Miflin were an ogress.
There seemed to be in them the same strange
quality that Miss Miflin had discovered in
William and Sarah,&mdash;a certain standing on
guard. It had prevented Miss Miflin from
writing to William to try to straighten out
the miserable tangle which they had made
of their friendship; it made her think of
Sarah as a rather reserved young woman,
instead of a lonely little girl. It made her
hesitate even to offer her sympathy now that
Sarah's father was dead. She was not a Pennsylvania
German, and it seemed to her that
they did not thoroughly trust her.</p>

<p>She was always prepared for the unexpected
in the twins' behavior; but when,
one morning late in March, they appeared at
the school-door carrying an old shot-gun,
the same which had done such deadly execution
upon the frightened Jacob Kalb, she
said aloud, "Well, what next!" Then she
went down the aisle to speak to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad to see you back, Ellen Louisa
and Louisa Ellen." She had long since discovered
that any attempt to abbreviate the
names of the twins was not received with
favor.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," the twins answered politely.
They could not have told why they
were so mischievous; it was a Topsy-like obsession
which they could not control. They
both blindly adored Miss Miflin.</p>

<p>"And why do you come to school armed
as though you were going to war?"</p>

<p>The twins giggled. The idea of going to
war pleased them.</p>

<p>"So nobody shall carry us off," answered
Louisa Ellen.</p>

<p>"Is anybody likely to carry you off?"
asked Miss Miflin, smiling. She had seen at
once that the gun was useless as a weapon.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," answered Ellen Louisa.</p>

<p>Miss Miflin smiled again. It was time to
begin school, and she supposed it was all one
of the twins' tricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put the gun in the corner and go to
your seats," she said.</p>

<p>An hour later Miss Miflin heard a stir in
the back of the room.</p>

<p>"Ellen&mdash;" she began. Then she followed
the children's gaze toward the window.</p>

<p>Sarah Wenner stood there, looking in, as
though she only meant to assure herself of
the twins' presence. But what a changed,
wild-eyed Sarah! Miss Miflin dropped chalk
and ruler and went to the door.</p>

<p>"Sarah!" she called.</p>

<p>Sarah came hurriedly from the other side
of the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean anything," she explained.
"I wanted just to see if Ellen Louisa and
Louisa Ellen were in school, that was all."</p>

<p>She did not say that the twins had added
another frightened hour to those which had
made her face so white. They had slipped
away while she went to the barn.</p>

<p>"Didn't you want them to come to
school?" asked Miss Miflin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ach, yes!" cried Sarah. "I want them
to go every day in the school."</p>

<p>Belief and the sight of Miss Miflin were
already patting some color into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Are you well, Sarah?" asked Miss Miflin.</p>

<p>"Ach, yes!" answered Sarah. "But now
I must go home. You must excuse me while
I disturbed the school for you. Here is lunch
for Ellen Louisa and Louisa Ellen, then
they need not come all the way home for
dinner. Will you&mdash;will you watch them, so
they do not go off to play at recess? Just
give it to them if they are not good. I will
then walk a piece way along to meet them
when they come home from school."</p>

<p>Sarah was gone before Miss Miflin could
ask any more questions. She saw her look
back as she tramped along the muddy road,
then she vanished behind a hedge of alders.
Miss Miflin was puzzled and disturbed.</p>

<p>It was almost an hour before Sarah reached
the Eberts' door. She was inexpressibly tired,
and the roads were deep with mud. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
not been sleeping well at night. Uncle
Daniel had made no farther move, but she
felt that the delay was only a truce. She had
seen nothing of Albert, though it had been
several weeks since his uncle had carried him
away. They were guarding him well.</p>

<p>Ebert had not come to plough, and Sarah
was worried. She had looked for him day after
day, and now she feared that he was sick.</p>

<p>She could get no answer when she knocked
at the door. The house was closed, yet in
the field near by the earth had been turned
up that morning. Why did they not answer?
She could not know that Mrs. Ebert watched
her from an upper window, with tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to tell her that you
wouldn't plough for her," she said to her husband
at noon.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I am not going to plough
and then let Swartz have the benefit," answered
Ebert.</p>

<p>Troubled and anxious, Sarah went on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>ward
home. As she turned to go up the lane
she saw a man at work in the north field.
Ah, Ebert had begun! Then her flying feet
halted. The horses were Uncle Daniel's
grays, the man was Jacob Kalb. Sarah cried
out as though she had been struck.</p>

<p>Then she saw that the fence was down.
It was not a worm-fence, which could be put
up again in a little while, but a stout "post
and rail." The posts had been taken out.
The two fields formed together a great slope
which ran from the Wenners' garden to the
edge of the Swartzes' yard.</p>

<p>Sarah gathered her shawl a little closer
about her and ran on.</p>

<p>"Get out, Jacob Kalb!" she called.</p>

<p>For a minute Jacob looked as though he
meant to run. He had protested against coming
to plough so near the house, for fear that
Sarah might "do him something." Now he
saw that Sarah did not carry a gun. He
mocked her rudely.</p>

<p>"Get out, Sarah Wenner!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, you shall go away, Jacob
Kalb," she shouted. "This is not your
land."</p>

<p>Jacob laughed. "<i>You</i> will have to go
pretty soon away," he said.</p>

<p>Sarah could eat no dinner, but sat at the
window watching. Already the boundary between
the two farms was fast disappearing.
How would they be able ever to find it again?
What would her mother and father have
said? What would William say when he came
home?</p>

<p><i>When</i> he came home. It was growing to be
<i>if</i> he came home in Sarah's mind. Anxiety
was doing its work.</p>

<p>She remembered things which she had
heard as a child and forgotten,&mdash;her mother's
sharp criticism of Daniel Swartz's meanness,
her father's good-natured laughter. She
did not know how easily that same dear,
thoughtless father might have made it impossible
for his brother-in-law to interfere
with them. He might easily have provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
another guardian for his children. He had
meant to,&mdash;that much must be said for him,&mdash;but
he was a procrastinator, and at the
end there had been no time.</p>

<p>Sarah could not go now to meet the twins
when they came from school; she did not dare
to leave the house. Jacob Kalb might take
possession while she was away.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed slowly. Toward evening,
there was a late flurry of snow. And
the twins did not come. Sarah ran part way
down the lane,&mdash;they were not yet in sight,&mdash;then
she went to the barn to milk, her
ears straining to hear any unfriendly sound.
It soothed and comforted her to be with the
friendly beasts which she loved. Both "Mooley"
and "Curly" had been born on the
place, they were part of the living fibre of
the homestead.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the twins called to
Sarah before they ran up to the door of
the barn, for another shock was more than
Sarah could have borne at that moment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
twins' voices trembled with some exciting
news.</p>

<p>"She came along home with us," said
Louisa Ellen.</p>

<p>"She carried the gun for us," said Ellen
Louisa.</p>

<p>"She is waiting at the front door."</p>

<p>"Who is waiting at the front door?" asked
Sarah. Then she added fearfully, "Aunt
Mena?"</p>

<p>"No, teacher."</p>

<p>"Teacher!" repeated Sarah. "Wh-what
did she come for? Have you then not been
smart?"</p>

<p>"For to see us," said Louisa Ellen impatiently.
"She is coming for company. She&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarah had crossed the lane, a milk-pail in
either hand.</p>

<p>"Come," she called, in a voice which was
meant to be a whisper, but which Miss
Miflin, waiting on the broad doorstep, heard
clearly. "Hurry yourselves, and fix a little up.
Perhaps&mdash;" Sarah could scarcely speak for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
excitement. "Perhaps she will stay for supper."</p>

<p>A moment later, she opened the front door.
Her black hair was brushed back a little more
closely to her head, her face shone, the great
white apron which she had hastily put on
over her gingham one was much longer than
her dress, and from the back her gray-stockinged
ankles could be seen outlined against
it in pathetic thinness.</p>

<p>"Come in, teacher," she begged shyly.
"Come once into the room [parlor] and I
will hurry make a fire."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Miss Miflin. "I'll come
back to the kitchen with you. I didn't come
to be company. I came to bring the twins
home, and the gun."</p>

<p>"The gun!" repeated Sarah. "Did they
then take the gun along? Come in. It doesn't
look here so good like always. I&mdash;I didn't
work this afternoon so very much. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Sarah ushered Miss Miflin into the
immaculate kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Miflin breathed a sigh of relief. The
chill of the house had struck into her heart.
Could William have lived <i>here</i>? Then she
saw the glow of the fire, the bright rag carpet,
the blooming geraniums in the window.
This looked like William. Miss Miflin put
out her hand and drew Ellen Louisa, in a
clean white apron, to her side. She, too, was
William's.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you would let me stay
for supper?" she asked.</p>

<p>The glow in Sarah's face answered her.</p>

<p>"If it is you good enough," answered
Sarah humbly.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" laughed Miss Miflin.
She pulled off her over-shoes and slipped out
of her coat. She had no home of her own,
and had been boarding at a country hotel
for three years. "But you children don't
stay here alone at night!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"But aren't you afraid?"</p>

<p>"Ach, no! Nobody would do us anything,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
stammered Sarah. She could not tell this
stranger any of their troubles.</p>

<p>"But haven't you a little brother?" Miss
Miflin looked round the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," answered Sarah. She suddenly
put out her hand, and laid it on Louisa
Ellen's shoulder, and Louisa Ellen closed her
lips as though she had meant to speak, but
had changed her mind. "Yes, Albert. He
is now by my uncle."</p>

<p>"And don't any of your uncle's people
come to stay with you at night?"</p>

<p>"Ach, no!" answered Sarah. Suddenly
she felt her voice give way. There was something
in Miss Miflin's brown, astonished eyes
which made her feel that she might cry. But
that would never do. "T-take a ch-chair.
I-I guess you had to laugh at how the twins
learned their lessons. I taught them while
they were at home."</p>

<p>"They learned them well," replied Miss
Miflin. "Now I am going to help get supper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The twins could scarcely believe their eyes.
It was as though a fairy had come to the
farmhouse, a dear, capable fairy, who could
dry dishes and cut bread, and magically
change tired, care-worn Sarah into the gay,
cheerful Sarah of old. It was almost nine
o'clock when Ellen Louisa turned from the
window, against which she had been flattening
her nose.</p>

<p>"It's snowing again," she announced.</p>

<p>Miss Miflin looked up in dismay. She had
forgotten how fast the time was passing.
Sarah never knew that, summoned by her
stories and her love, it seemed to Miss Miflin
that William was there with them.</p>

<p>"I shall have to go at once," she cried.
"I had no idea it was so late."</p>

<p>Sarah clasped her hands together.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to stay here," she said.
"If it is you good enough, you are welcome
to stay here!"</p>

<p>Miss Miflin crossed the room to look out
of the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess I'll have to. Then I can take the
twins with me to school in the morning and
they won't need the gun. And why do they
want to run away, where some one might pick
them up? And who wants to pick them up?"</p>

<p>It was a second before Sarah answered.
Suppose she should tell Miss Miflin about
Uncle Daniel, and about Jacob Kalb, and all
her anxieties and fears? But, no, it would
never do. It made her ashamed to think of
Uncle Daniel. She did not believe William
would like her to tell. She frowned again at
Louisa Ellen.</p>

<p>"Ach, they are a little wild," she explained.
"They like their school, but they are a
little wild."</p>

<p>By this time Miss Miflin had a delighted
and sleepy twin on each side of her on the
settle.</p>

<p>"But they are not going to be wild any
more," she said.</p>

<p>Sarah was asleep that night almost before
her head touched the pillow. It seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
her that peace had descended upon her heart,
and hopes for a better day.</p>

<p>It was midnight when she suddenly awoke.
Miss Miflin was standing beside the bed.</p>

<p>"Sarah! Sarah, dear, wake up. Your uncle
is here and wants you."</p>

<p>Sarah tried to open her drowsy eyes.</p>

<p>"He can't have them," she said, bewildered.
"Tell him he must go away."</p>

<p>"But listen, Sarah. He says Albert is sick
and they want you."</p>

<p>Sarah sat up at once.</p>

<p>"He is waiting for you at the door. Come,
I'll help you with your clothes. Don't come
back to-night. I'll get breakfast for the twins.
No, Sarah, the other shoe. No, you must put
on all your warm clothes. There! Now, I'll
come downstairs with you."</p>

<p>Sarah was too dazed with fright and sleep
to speak. Miss Miflin was shocked at the
anguish in her face. She put out her arms,
and for one blessed moment Sarah felt the
close pressure of sympathy and love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, Sarah, dear! I'll look after the
twins and the house, and to-morrow you must
tell me everything, Sarah."</p>

<p>Miss Miflin opened the door, and told Uncle
Daniel who she was, and Sarah went out.
With confidence which touched even Uncle
Daniel himself, she put her hand in his.</p>

<p>"Come, let us hurry," she whispered.</p>

<div class="chapter"><hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">THE BLOW FALLS</p></div>


<p class="p2">Sarah never forgot the wet, cold walk
across the fields. The stars were out, and
there was promise of a clear day, but the
melted snow made the soil wet and muddy,
and the air was damp. Uncle Daniel strode
on, without remembering to moderate his
long steps, and Sarah almost ran by his side.</p>

<p>She was wide awake now, the cool air on
her face banished all drowsiness of body,
and Albert's danger roused every faculty of
her mind.</p>

<p>"How long was he sick already?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Since this morning. But he has been for
a couple of days not so good."</p>

<p>"Where is he sick?"</p>

<p>"He won't eat nothing, and&mdash;and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
don't know us. He&mdash;he&mdash;" Uncle Daniel's
voice shook. He had had a hard day. He
was desperately frightened about Albert,
and Aunt 'Liza had not made him more comfortable
by insisting that it was a punishment
for wanting his sister's farm.</p>

<p>"He will know me," answered Sarah with
conviction. Then she began to run up the
lane toward the house. She could see a light
in an upstairs room, and Aunt Eliza's face
was already peering anxiously out of the
kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Albert is worse," she called. "He is
talking all the time."</p>

<p>Sarah pushed past her into the kitchen.
She had not been in the house since she was
a little girl,&mdash;so entirely apart had been the
lives of the two families,&mdash;but she knew the
way to the stairway door. One after another
the natural ills of childhood came to her
mind. Albert and the twins had had chickenpox
and measles and whooping-cough and
mumps, and she had nursed them all. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
thought of the dreaded scarlet fever and
diphtheria. But there was none in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>She hurried up the stairway, as there
floated down a tiny, querulous voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want my Sarah! I want my Sarah!"</p>

<p>Albert lay deep in the great feather-bed,
his cheeks a flaming crimson, his arms tossing
restlessly. Even when Sarah bent over
him, he did not know her, but kept on with
his restless crying. She put her hand on his
hot forehead, she opened the collar of his
night-gown.</p>

<p>When Aunt Eliza and Uncle Daniel came
into the room, she turned upon them a look
of such anguish that Aunt 'Liza began to
cry, and Uncle Daniel sat down weakly in a
chair.</p>

<p>"Is it the smallpox?" asked Aunt 'Liza
fearfully.</p>

<p>Sarah did not answer. She looked at
Albert once more. Long before, when her
mother was living, the twins had found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Christmas candy, and had eaten it all in a day.
Then the twins had had a sorry time. They
had looked just like this.</p>

<p>"What did you give Albert to eat?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"Ach! bread and meat and potatoes and
pie, like always, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what?" insisted Sarah.</p>

<p>"And a few crullers."</p>

<p>"And what yet?"</p>

<p>"And a little candy."</p>

<p>"How much candy?"</p>

<p>"Ach, such a little bag full."</p>

<p>"And what yet?"</p>

<p>"A few peanuts," answered Uncle Daniel
doggedly.</p>

<p>"Get me warm water and mustard," commanded
Sarah.</p>

<p>"C-can you make him well, Sarah?"
faltered Aunt 'Liza. But she did not stop
to hear the answer. At that moment she did
not even feel the humiliation of having to
obey fifteen-year-old Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>In less than an hour, a watcher might
have seen the lights in the Swartz farmhouse
go out, one by one. Albert was asleep long
before that, the flush faded from his cheek,
the fever gone, a faint smile upon the little
face on Sarah's arm. It would have been
hard to tell which slept more soundly, doctor
or patient.</p>

<p>In the next room Daniel Swartz lay wide
awake. These weeks of Albert's stay with
them had not been easy. It was not entirely
pie and cake and candy which had made
Albert sick; it was a disease which no heroic
measures could cure, homesickness, and
Uncle Daniel knew it.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a young one," he said
angrily. "I was never so very for my brothers
and sisters when I was little."</p>

<p>"Will you let him go home?" asked
Aunt 'Liza timidly. The last weeks had worn
more heavily upon her than upon her husband,
since she had to watch all day long that
white, woe-begone little face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let him go home!" repeated Swartz.
"When I am to be guardian to-morrow! I
guess not. To-morrow Sarah has to come
here. That will cure him."</p>

<p>It was long after daybreak when Sarah
woke. Albert slept quietly beside her, and it
was not likely that he would wake for several
hours. She dressed hurriedly and went downstairs.</p>

<p>There she found Aunt Liza washing dishes
and Uncle Daniel moving impatiently about,
dressed in his best clothes.</p>

<p>"I didn't go yet to town, because I want
to talk to you a little, Sarah," he began.
"Sit down once and Aunt 'Lizie will give
you your breakfast."</p>

<p>"But I must go home," objected Sarah.
"Albert will be all right, only he must
not have anything to eat yet awhile, only
milk to drink. And he mustn't have candy,
or he will get just so sick for you again. He
is too little to have so much candy."</p>

<p>"But you stay here now and take care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
him," invited Uncle Daniel pleasantly. Now
that he had everything in his hands he was
prepared to be thoroughly amiable.</p>

<p>"I can come back," replied Sarah. His
good humor frightened her, and she moved
a little closer to the door. "But first I
must go and milk. It is already late to
milk."</p>

<p>"Jacob Kalb's wife went down this long
time to milk," put in Aunt 'Liza.</p>

<p>"Jacob Kalb's wife!" repeated Sarah.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go down and she can go home,"
said Sarah. "I&mdash;I don't need Jacob Kalb's
wife to help. Then I can come back to see
Albert."</p>

<p>She remembered afterwards that Aunt
'Liza had begun to speak, and that she had
been sharply checked by Uncle Daniel. But
she did not wait to hear. Jacob Kalb's wife
was only a shade less disagreeable than Jacob
himself. She could not bear to think of
her touching her milk-pans or going into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
spring-house or kitchen. She ran as swiftly
as she could down across the fields.</p>

<p>When she reached the kitchen door, she
was faint with exhaustion. At first everything
was black before her. Then she saw
Jacob Kalb's wife standing by the stove. She
was a large, fair-haired woman, with strong,
bare arms. She had just lifted a pie from the
oven and stood with it still in her hands,
looking at little Sarah.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;you needn't bake for me," said
Sarah when she could get her breath. "I am
much obliged that you did the milking, but
you need not bake for me."</p>

<p>"I am baking for myself," answered Mrs.
Kalb stolidly.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't bake <i>here</i>," cried
Sarah.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a rush of comprehension.
It seemed for an instant as though she
could neither breathe nor think. Her uncle
had made Albert sick, he had sent for her to
cure him, and then he had sent this woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
down here to take possession. She moved a
step closer.</p>

<p>"Go out of my kitchen," she commanded
thickly. "This is my kitchen, it isn't yours.
These are my things, they are not yours.
They are not my uncle's. He had no right
to send you here. You could be arrested for
it. It is stealing. Get out of my kitchen."</p>

<p>Suddenly everything seemed to grow black
once more, and Sarah reeled. The woman
came toward her.</p>

<p>"Are you sick? You better sit down once.
It isn't my fault that I have to live here. If
I don't live here, somebody else will. Let
me take off your shawl for you."</p>

<p>"Ach, no!" cried little Sarah. "Don't
touch me! Don't touch me!"</p>

<p>"I guess I won't do you anything if I touch
you," answered the woman, the kindness in
her voice changing to irritation. "Well, what
in the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarah had gone, leaving the door open behind
her. Mrs. Kalb watched her run down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the lane, stopping occasionally to gasp for
breath.</p>

<p>"Let her go and talk to Swartz," muttered
Mrs. Kalb to herself. Then she went back
to her work.</p>

<p>Sarah did not turn to go across the fields
to the Swartz house, but went on out to the
high-road. There she stood, looking about
her, bewildered.</p>

<p>The blow had fallen at last. She had expected
it hourly, but she had not foreseen such
heartache as this. She had no home, and the
children had no home, and William, <i>if</i> he
came back, would have no home. The children
might grow accustomed to life at Aunt
Mena's and Uncle Daniel's,&mdash;she knew nothing
then of Albert's homesickness,&mdash;but
it would not be home. They would grow
away from one another, they would not be
like the children of one family.</p>

<p>She could not cry, she was too wretched
for tears, she could only stand there in the
road in the sunshine, trying to decide where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
she should go. Then suddenly there came to
her the touch of Miss Miflin's arms and the
sound of Miss Miflin's voice.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, you must tell me everything."</p>

<p>She did not stop to listen to another voice,
which told her that Miss Miflin was a stranger
who could not really care, and who could not
help. She started away, not running now,&mdash;she
was too tired for that,&mdash;but walking as
fast as she could, toward the Spring Grove
Schoolhouse.</p>

<p>Recess had just begun, and the children,
all but the twins, who had been granted the
treasured privilege of cleaning the blackboards,
were in the playground. They looked
up curiously as Sarah went by. The Wenners
had always been clannish. Even the
twins were happier playing by themselves
than with the other children.</p>

<p>Miss Miflin was shocked at the sight of
Sarah's face. She had not worried about her,
because the woman who had come to milk
had said that Albert was better, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Sarah was still asleep. She had made up her
mind to go back to the Wenners' that night.
Perhaps if there were a grown person in
the house Sarah would rest, and thus lose
some of the weariness which showed so
plainly in her eyes.</p>

<p>Now in addition to the weariness, there
was distress such as Miss Miflin had never
seen on the face of a young person. She
went down the aisle to meet her.</p>

<p>"Well, Sarah," she began. Then she put
out both her arms. "Why, you poor little
girl! What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Jacob Kalb is living in our house," said
Sarah hoarsely. "We have no home any
more. The twins must go to Aunt Mena,
and Albert to Uncle Daniel. We have no
home any more. He took it away from us.
It is not right."</p>

<p>Miss Miflin helped Sarah to her own chair.
Then she took the county paper from her
desk.</p>

<p>"Sarah, I saw something about you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the children in the paper last week. Don't
you know your uncle is to be your guardian?"</p>

<p>"Guardian?" repeated Sarah.</p>

<p>"Yes, here it is. 'Daniel Swartz, of
Spring Grove township, has applied to be
appointed guardian of Sarah, Ellen Louisa,
Louisa Ellen, and Albert Wenner, minor
children of Henry Wenner, deceased.' Oh,
Sarah, that means you will have to do as he
says!"</p>

<p>"We would have to do as he says whether
he was guardian or not," said Sarah dully.
"He wants to take the farm. He has already
taken the fence down. It is nothing to be
done." Then she burst into tears. "If they
would only give me a chance once! If they
would let me try, I could show them what I
could do. I know how the crops should be,
and Ebert would work for the half, now like
always. It would be just like when my pop
was alive. Or if Uncle Daniel would farm
and give us the half, like Ebert, so we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
get along. Then we could stay together.
But now we have nothing. If William comes
home, he won't have any place to go. He
won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen a minute, Sarah!" said Miss
Miflin. Then she did not go on at once, but
turned over the paper with hands which
trembled.</p>

<p>"Who makes him guardian?" asked
Sarah.</p>

<p>"The judge," replied Miss Miflin absently.</p>

<p>"If I only could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Miss Miflin again.
"It may not have been decided yet. Perhaps
if we went in, they would let us talk.
Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her hand went out suddenly to the bell-rope.</p>

<p>"There is a train in half an hour. We
shall have to hurry. Come, children, get
your caps and shawls. There will be no more
school till to-morrow."</p>

<p>Sarah looked at her dully. She had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
idea of what Miss Miflin meant to do. The
children vanished with whoops of delight
over the unexpected holiday.</p>

<p>"Now, Sarah, we are going to town."</p>

<p>"To town! To the <i>county seat</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I have no money!"</p>

<p>"Well, I have."</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;I cannot leave the twins!"</p>

<p>"They are to come too."</p>

<p>"In these clothes?" Sarah had never
been to the county seat but once, and then
she had worn her best.</p>

<p>"Yes. There isn't time to get any others."</p>

<p>While Miss Miflin spoke, she locked the
door of the schoolhouse, and took Sarah's
arm in hers. Her cheeks were flushed, and
she looked anxious and worried. She was perfectly
aware that it was probably a fruitless
errand upon which she was starting. Before
they could get to the county seat, the appointment
might be made. And even if they did
get there in time, she was not sure whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
anything could be done. If they failed, it
might not only make it harder for the children,
but she might lose her school. Daniel
Swartz was a man of influence and a school-director,
and he could easily prevent her re-election
if he tried.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of all the dictates of
reason and common sense, Miss Miflin had
an inward conviction that she was right. She
knew vaguely that there had been some
trouble between the Swartz and Wenner families,
and that Henry Wenner would never
have chosen his brother-in-law to be guardian
of his children. Surely that would have some
weight with the judge!</p>

<p>If Sarah could only be led to talk, if she
could make the judge believe that she was
able to run the farm and look after the children,
he might, as Sarah had said, be willing
to "let her try." And deep in Miss Miflin's
heart was the remembrance of Sarah's anguished
cry, "If William comes home, he
won't have any place to go."</p>

<div class="caption">THE STATION AGENT LOOKED AT THEM CURIOUSLY</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>If William came home! Miss Miflin sighed
for some of the childish affection which followed
thoughtless, wandering William. Suppose
that he should come home, ill, penniless,
where would he go? Miss Miflin drew Sarah's
hand a little closer within her arm.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Sarah," she said. "We'll win."</p>

<p>Even the station agent, accustomed to provincial
costumes, looked at them curiously as
they got on the train. Miss Miflin wore her
school suit and hat,&mdash;no one could have
found fault with them upon the grounds of
suitability or becomingness. But Sarah and
the twins, in their striped shawls and sunbonnets,
were very unlike what one would
have expected Miss Miflin's companions to
be.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that they were her companions,
however, for she asked the conductor
to reverse a seat, and with Sarah beside
her, and the eager, restless twins opposite,
she was as oblivious of the interested stares
of the passengers as though she were in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
own class-room at Spring Grove. The twins
were wild with delight at the journey. Here
was another adventure, more exciting than
running away from Aunt Mena, or carrying
a gun to school.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with an hour's start, and
behind Betty, the fast little mare, Uncle Daniel
and Jacob Kalb were just finishing the
twelve-mile journey to the county seat.</p>

<div class="chapter"><hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">THE ORPHANS' COURT</p></div>


<p class="p2">The curious eyes which watched Miss Miflin
and the children on the train were multiplied
tenfold when they found themselves on the
streets of the county seat. Miss Miflin was
pretty enough to attract attention anywhere,
but she had never before been so frankly stared
at. She was well aware that the children in their
striped shawls and little sunbonnets and gray
home-knit stockings looked strange in a
town where for twenty years little girls had
been wearing coats and hats.</p>

<p>"Is it a show?" she heard one impertinent
boy ask another.</p>

<p>"See here, once," a man exclaimed.
"That's the way the little girls looked when
I was a boy."</p>

<p>Miss Miflin was the only member of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
party who was at all disturbed by the interested
residents of the county seat. The
tired look was gone from Sarah's face, her
eyes sparkled; for a few minutes, in her delight
over the strange sights, she forgot her
anxiety and fear. Here were the wonderful
"electricity cars," which frightened the twins
nearly out of their wits.</p>

<p>"Where are then the horses?" they demanded
together. "What makes it go? Will
it come after us?"</p>

<p>The twins held each other tightly by the
hand, their desire to run ahead and their
fear of becoming separated from Miss Miflin
making their gait very uncertain. Once she
and Sarah almost stumbled over them, when
they stopped short to contemplate the wonders
of the tall Powers Building, in course
of erection on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>Miss Miflin was not sorry when the gray
walls of the court house appeared before them.
She would be glad to get her charges safely
within doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The twins, however, had stopped again.
They had loosened their grasp on each other,
and were standing with clasped hands and
rapturous gaze.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Miss Miflin. Then
she followed their glance to a little peanut
and candy stand near by.</p>

<p>"Peanuts!" said Louisa Ellen rapturously.</p>

<p>"Candy!" said Ellen Louisa.</p>

<p>There was a shocked "Ach, aren't you
ashamed!" from Sarah, and a laugh from
Miss Miflin.</p>

<p>"Wait till we go home," she said.</p>

<p>Then, together, she and Sarah pushed open
the heavy door of the court house.</p>

<p>They found themselves in a great, empty
hall, with many doors on each side. The twins,
after a moment's silent contemplation, tried
to puzzle out the signs above the doors.
"Clerk of the Court" was easy. "District
Attorney" and "Prothonotary" were harder.</p>

<p>"Are we going to one of those places?"
whispered Louisa Ellen. They had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
been to a circus, but they were feeling the
same pleasant thrills that a small boy would
feel at sight of the closed tents.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Miss Miflin,
more to herself than to them. "We must
see some one."</p>

<p>"Could I go and ask?" inquired Sarah.</p>

<p>"No," answered Miss Miflin. "Are you
afraid to wait here a minute with the twins,
while I see what I can do?"</p>

<p>At that moment a door at the upper end
of the hall opened, and a tall gentleman
came toward them. At sight of them his step
slackened, and he looked at them curiously.
He, too, remembered the little Pennsylvania
German schoolhouse to which he had gone
as a small boy. He did not wait for Miss
Miflin to speak to him.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do for you?"
he asked courteously.</p>

<p>Miss Miflin looked up into the kindly face.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. But it would take a few minutes
to explain, and I don't like to keep you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be glad to help. Only&mdash;"
The gentleman looked back over his shoulder.
The door of the prothonotary's office
had opened. In a moment two or three idle
young clerks would be in the hall, curious
to see the girl whose voice they heard. He
opened the nearest door, and stepped back
for Miss Miflin and the twins to enter.
"Come in here," he said.</p>

<p>The little room into which they went was
stiffly furnished in the fashion of fifty years
ago, as an ante-room to the judge's private
office. It was not often used; the horsehair-covered
chairs, set neatly against the wall,
and the dark heavy velvet curtains were
unworn. To the twins it was a marvelously
beautiful place. Miss Miflin and Sarah saw
nothing but the kindly face which invited
them to tell their story.</p>

<p>"These children are orphans," Miss Miflin
began. "Their father was Henry Wenner of
Spring Grove township, who died about a
month ago. He had been an invalid for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
years, and Sarah, the oldest girl, managed
the farm."</p>

<p>"Ebert ploughed for me and farmed for
the half," explained Sarah. She had taken
her sunbonnet off, and her bright eyes looked
first at the stranger, then at Miss Miflin.
"He would help me yet. I could get good
along, if they would only leave me be."</p>

<p>"The father made no will, and no provision
for the children, but it was his wish that
they stay together."</p>

<p>"And mom said always so too," added
Sarah.</p>

<p>"Are there any relatives?" asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes, their mother's brother, Daniel
Swartz. He lives on the next farm. But
there was never any friendship between the
two families while these children's parents
lived. Now he has made application to be appointed
guardian, and it doesn't seem necessary
or right that he should be. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You see it is this way," said Sarah. "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
wanted always the farm. It was once all my
gran'pop's farm. He wanted my pop and
mom should move away and sell it to him
once. Now he won't have it that we keep it
like my pop said we should. The twins shall
live by Aunt Mena, and Albert and I shall
live by him, and we won't have no home any
more, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Miflin laid a hand on Sarah's knee.</p>

<p>"We didn't mean to trouble you with all
this," she said gently. "I just wanted to
know what we should do, to whom we should
go. I thought that if Daniel Swartz hadn't
been made guardian yet, perhaps there was
some way of stopping it, and you could tell
us to what official we should apply."</p>

<p>"There would have to be a hearing before
the judge, and their uncle would have to be
notified, so that he could defend himself,"
answered the gentleman slowly. He looked
down once more at Sarah and the twins.
"They are pretty young to be looking after
themselves," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am fifteen years old," said Sarah. "And
if they would take the farm and only leave
me raise chickens I can get along."</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes met Miss Miflin's.</p>

<p>"She is a very capable little girl," said
Miss Miflin.</p>

<p>Then the twins, who had marveled at the
"electricity cars" and the tall buildings, were
still further astonished. The gentleman got
up and crossed the room, and took down
a little horn which was hanging against the
wall. Then he began to talk. The twins'
mouths opened involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Is this the clerk's office? Can you get
Weaver and his client&mdash;" He turned to
Sarah. "What did you say the uncle's name
is? Swartz? Oh yes&mdash;Can you get Weaver
and Swartz here for a hearing this afternoon?
They're in the court-house now? Oh,
very well. Yes, right away."</p>

<p>Then the stranger hung up the little horn
once more. He smiled at Miss Miflin and the
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you mind coming to tell the judge
what you have told me?" he said.</p>

<p>"Will it be in the court-room?" asked
Miss Miflin. She grew more and more poignantly
conscious of the strangeness of her
errand. But this stranger was evidently accustomed
to court business and he seemed
encouraging.</p>

<p>"Oh no. The sessions of the Orphans'
Court are held in the judge's office. This
way." And he opened a door leading into the
next room.</p>

<p>Miss Miflin felt Sarah's tight grasp on her
arm, and the twins came close behind. This
room was much larger than the one they were
leaving. There was no carpet on the floor,
and no attempt at elegant furniture. At one
end was a plain, businesslike desk, and the
twenty or thirty chairs which stood about
the room were straight and uncushioned.</p>

<p>To Miss Miflin's distress, almost every chair
was occupied. The stranger frowned a little
when he saw the audience. It took a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
short time for the news of an interesting case
to spread through the court-house.</p>

<p>But Miss Miflin's surprise was nothing to
be compared to the surprise of two of the occupants
of the wooden chairs. Daniel Swartz's
eyes widened, and Jacob Kalb nudged him
visibly.</p>

<p>"It is Sarah and the zwillings," he cried.
"Sarah and the zwillings!"</p>

<p>Uncle Daniel had had a moment of severe
fright. The lawyer had told him that they
had only to go to the court-house to get the
papers. But his fright passed.</p>

<p>"Pooh, what do I care?" he said. "I have
my lawyer, and I paid him twenty-five dollars
already. I am not afraid of no zwillings.
Nor yet no school-teacher," he added under
his breath. In Uncle Daniel's mind, the days
of Miss Miflin in the Spring Grove School
were numbered.</p>

<p>But the surprises were not yet over. The
tall gentleman found places for Miss Miflin
and the children near the desk at the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of the room. Sarah looked up at him with a
mixture of gratitude and alarm.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you stay by us?" she whispered.</p>

<p>The stranger laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm not going away," he answered. Then
to the amazement of Miss Miflin and Sarah
and the consternation of Daniel Swartz, he
took his place behind the desk.</p>

<p>"They were already by the judge!" said
Uncle Daniel. "It is not fair, it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd advise you to be quiet," said Mr.
Weaver curtly.</p>

<p>Sarah seized Miss Miflin's arm.</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;was&mdash;it <i>him</i>?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Miss Miflin. "It was."</p>

<p>She saw the judge smiling at their surprise,
and she felt suddenly that it was all
less of a wild-goose chase than she had feared.</p>

<p>It was comforting, also, that there was
about this hearing none of the formality of
a court trial. The judge wore no gown, there
was no prisoners' dock, no loud-voiced crier;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
it was more like the office of a country squire.
Miss Miflin whispered to the twins to take
off their sunbonnets, and not to speak unless
the judge spoke to them.</p>

<p>The clerk of the court read Daniel Swartz's
application, and then Mr. Weaver rose. He
had not anticipated any objections, and he
was not in a good humor. He felt that he
was wasting his time over an unimportant
case. He said briefly that the children had
no natural guardian, except their uncle Daniel
Swartz, an upright, prosperous man, who
was willing to take from his own important
business the time necessary to look after
their affairs.</p>

<p>"He is a school-director, a member of the
Reformed Church in good standing, and a
prosperous farmer. Could a more suitable
person be found? The oldest of the children
is fourteen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am fifteen," said Sarah.</p>

<p>The men in the court-room smiled, and the
lawyer went on as though he had not heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be years before she is of age.
How can such a child possibly look after a
farm and bring up three children? They do
not <i>want</i> a guardian; few children would,
after having been allowed to run loose for
years. But in their own interest, and in
the interest especially of these younger children,
I ask that Daniel Swartz be made
their guardian."</p>

<p>Daniel Swartz looked about complacently,
as if challenging those near him to prove
that the lawyer's statements were untrue.</p>

<p>"To-morrow she loses her school," he
said to Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>Then he saw that the judge was speaking
to Miss Miflin.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Helen Miflin."</p>

<p>"You are a school-teacher?"</p>

<p>"I teach in the Spring Grove Schoolhouse."</p>

<p>"What interest have you in this case?"</p>

<p>The judge saw that the flush on Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Miflin's cheek deepened, but he thought it
was only a flush of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I am fond of these children, and I do
not believe the appointment of Mr. Swartz
as guardian is necessary or right."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because for years the families have not
been friendly, and Mr. Wenner would never
have chosen Mr. Swartz as the guardian of
his children, and because the children do
not like him."</p>

<p>"Like me!" exclaimed Daniel Swartz to
the lawyer. "What dumb talk! It makes
nothing out if they like me or not."</p>

<p>"You will have to be quiet," answered
Mr. Weaver. "It makes a good deal of difference
in the appointment of a guardian."</p>

<p>"Sarah Wenner," said the judge.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Sarah.</p>

<p>"Why don't you want to live with your
uncle, and have him look after your affairs?"</p>

<p>"Because my mom said we should stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
always together. It is not right that children
have no home of their own. And my
pop was for three years sick, and Ebert
helped us, and we got good along. He
worked for the half. And I can raise chickens.
And the twins are always good for
me, and Albert is always good for me, and
Uncle Daniel, he knows I can get along.
Albert is already by him, and he gave him
candy till he was sick and I had to go to
cure him. He don't know how to bring up
children, and Aunt 'Lizie don't know. He&mdash;he
is always after us. And he came for me
in the night to go to Albert, and when I went
back in the morning Jacob Kalb was living
there already, and baking pies, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>At thought of the morning, the tears
came into Sarah's eyes, and her voice
choked. "If he would only l-leave me be."</p>

<p>"That will do," said the judge kindly.
He thought that he had never seen the
court-house clerks so quiet. "And you," he
said to the twins, "aren't you willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
be good little girls, and do as Uncle Daniel
wants you to?"</p>

<p>The twins looked up at the judge, then
round the room. They were frightened and
puzzled. They thought this kindly gentleman
was on their side, but he had made
Sarah cry, and now he wanted them to obey
Uncle Daniel. Then Louisa Ellen put out
her hand and nudged Ellen Louisa.</p>

<p>The eyes of the judge and the clerks followed
theirs. Uncle Daniel was smiling at
them graciously,&mdash;he who usually frowned
so crossly. And as Uncle Daniel smiled, he
put his hand into his pocket and drew out
two shining dollars.</p>

<p>To the court-room Uncle Daniel's purpose
was evident. The court-room held its
breath. Louisa Ellen's hand tightened on
Ellen Louisa's.</p>

<p>"Uncle Daniel is going to give us a dollar!"
she said, in tones of such wonder and
amazement that the court-room rocked with
mirth.</p>

<div class="caption">UNCLE DANIEL SMILED AND DREW OUT TWO SHINING DOLLARS</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Order!" said the judge, after a long
minute.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Weaver knew&mdash;though Uncle
Daniel did not as yet&mdash;that his cause was
lost. Uncle Daniel put the money back into
his pocket, shamefacedly. This would be
another score to settle with the twins when
this foolish court business was over. Then
he heard that the judge was speaking.</p>

<p>"Whom would you like to have for your
guardian, children?"</p>

<p>Sarah looked up at Miss Miflin. To her
the word guardian meant unpleasant oversight,
interference. Must they have a guardian
at all? But Miss Miflin did not seem
troubled in the least. What she said was
unpremeditated; she did not realize until
after the words were out that the lawyer's
sharp eyes and the judge's kindly eyes
were watching her so closely, nor could she
foresee that her face would become a flaming
crimson.</p>

<p>"I don't see why they need a guardian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
at all," she said. "They have an older
brother."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the judge. "Why, then, was
the application made?"</p>

<p>At that moment Jacob Kalb had come
finally to the conclusion that he had been
silent long enough.</p>

<p>"He went three years ago already to
Alaska," he said. "He will never come
home."</p>

<p>"Oh, he will!" cried little Sarah.</p>

<p>"And if he does come home," went on
Jacob Kalb coolly, "what will he have to
say about the school-board money that he
took along with him to Alaska?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for shame!" cried Miss Miflin.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jacob. "Stealing is a
shame."</p>

<p>"He did <i>not</i> steal!" Miss Miflin's voice
shook. She knew they were watching her
curiously; she heard the door open to admit
another inquisitive clerk, who she saw dimly
was tall and broad of shoulder, but she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
not care if the whole world were there to
hear. "His father paid the money, and he
has never had any chance to defend himself."</p>

<p>"Stealing is stealing," said Jacob Kalb
doggedly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">"AND NOW WE WILL GO HOME"</p></div>


<p class="p2">On the day upon which she took possession
of the Wenner homestead, Mrs. Jacob Kalb
was destined to have more than one shock.
She let two pies burn while she thought of
little Sarah, who looked so ill, and who had
started away so wildly. She was just about
to put on her shawl and go up to the Swartz
house, to ask whether Sarah was there, when
the door opened again.</p>

<p>This time it was not pushed open by
Sarah's gentle hand, but was flung back, as
though the master of the house were about
to enter.</p>

<p>Thinking it was her husband, Mrs. Kalb
did not turn at once.</p>

<p>"Well, did you get back?" she asked.</p>

<p>Then, with her arms uplifted to the hook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
where her shawl hung, she looked round
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>A tall young man stood, not on the step,
where tramps and agents belonged, but in
the kitchen itself, his hand on Mrs. Kalb's
freshly scrubbed table.</p>

<p>"Get out of my kitchen," she commanded.
She was afraid of no tramps, but there was
something in the clear gaze of this young
man which frightened her. But he was clean
and sober, and he looked like some one whom
she knew. "What do you want?" she asked
in a more friendly tone.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Jacob Kalb, and this is my
house."</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;" said the young man, and
Mrs. Kalb never told the story afterwards
without crying&mdash;"where is my mother?"</p>

<p>"Your mother!" she repeated. She stared
at him with open mouth. Then she said
slowly, "It is William Wenner that you look
like."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"But where," said the young man again,
"is my mother? And my father?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kalb's shawl dropped slowly to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Don't you <i>know</i>?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything," said the young
man. "I have been away for three years. I
have had no letters for two years, until last
week. Then I found one in Seattle. I&mdash;"
He drew Sarah's poor, little, incoherent
letter from his pocket. "I couldn't make
out what my little sister meant. She says
nothing about my mother or my father."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kalb was after all a very different
person from her husband. She came round
to where the young man was standing and
made him sit down, and put a kind hand on
his shoulder, while she told him.</p>

<p>"And you came now just in time," she
sobbed. "The little ones shall go to Uncle
Daniel and Aunt Mena, and he will take the
farm. The fences are down already, and he
is to be guardian. He went this morning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
town to get the papers. He and Jacob went.
He said we were to live here. But I wouldn't
'a' come, only somebody would have to live
here, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man was upon his feet.</p>

<p>"Where is my little sister?"</p>

<p>"By Aunt 'Liza. And Albert is there,
and Ellie and Weezy are at school." Then
she followed him to the door. "I won't be
here any more when you come back. And I
will have everything cleaned up, and I will
leave some pies."</p>

<p>If she had doubted his identity, she would
have been convinced by the quick turn
which he made beyond the lilac-bushes, in
order to take the shortest cut across the
fields. She saw him stop for an instant to
stare at the long, unbroken slope, which
stretched clear to Uncle Daniel's door, then
he hurried on.</p>

<p>Aunt Eliza was frightened almost out of
her wits. He did not speak to her or greet her,
except to say, "Where is my little sister?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"William!" screamed Aunt 'Liza. "Ach,
William, did you come home?"</p>

<p>"Where is my little sister?" He had
always been fond of Aunt Eliza, and she
had always been kind to him. But now
there was no room in his heart for anything
but grief and resentment and anxiety.</p>

<p>"She is&mdash;ach, I don't know where she is.
She went this long time home. But Jacob
Kalb lives now at your house. Ellie and
Weezy are at school, perhaps she went to
them. She is very for the teacher. Perhaps&mdash;Here
is your little brother, William.
Here is Albert. He is&mdash;he is&mdash;" And Aunt
'Liza burst into tears.</p>

<p>William stooped to kiss him, his lips
trembling.</p>

<p>"Where is my uncle?"</p>

<p>"He is gone to&mdash;town, William. Ach, sit
down once!"</p>

<p>"No," said William curtly. "I'll come
back after a while for Albert."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>And he was gone, his straight young
shoulders bent.</p>

<p>He had suffered hardship and disappointment,
but nothing had torn his heart like
this. They must have written, they could
not have been so cruel as to have forgotten
him. It was a common thing for letters to
be lost.</p>

<p>He read Sarah's letter once more as he
strode along. She said that Uncle Daniel
was after them, and that she had chased
Jacob Kalb off with a gun. He knew Uncle
Daniel's stern determination to have his own
way, he knew how he coveted the farm, he
knew Jacob's meanness. After that he ran
until he came to the schoolhouse door.
That, he found, was closed.</p>

<p>He rapped heavily; there was no answer.
Then he looked in the window. The room
was empty. As he was turning away in despair,
he heard some one calling him.</p>

<p>"The school is closed. It won't be open
till to-morrow. Miss Miflin went away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the woman who lived in the next
house. She had been a schoolmate of his
when he was a little boy.</p>

<p>"Miss Miflin?" he repeated slowly. "Is
she here yet? Don't you know me, Sallie?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the woman. "I&mdash;Why,
<i>William</i>!" She had both his hands in hers,
and could only stare at him speechlessly.
"Why, William! What am I so glad to&mdash;"
Then she, too, began to cry. "I can't help
it, William. I am so sorry for you. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about my little
sister?" asked William. "They said she had
come over here."</p>

<p>"Yes, and she was crying, and she talked
to teacher, and they went away, and Ellie
and Weezy. They went to town. It was
something about a guardian. I heard them
talking. But I don't believe they could catch
the nine o'clock train. Perhaps they are yet
at the station. It is another train at eleven."
She finished her sentence in a loud shriek as
William, after glancing at his watch, ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
down the road. "Come soon to see us,
William."</p>

<p>She watched him until he vanished at the
turn of the road, then she ran out to the
field to tell her husband.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sarah had often pictured to herself what
she would do when William came home.
Sometimes she seemed to see him coming up
the lane, and herself flying down to meet
him. Sometimes he opened the door and
came into the kitchen and surprised her.
Sometimes she imagined that she would cry;
at other times, after she had been reading,
for ten or fifteen minutes at a time, "Thaddeus
of Warsaw," the one novel which the
Wenners possessed, she was sure that she
should faint. But in all her imaginings, she
never dreamed that she should not know
him.</p>

<p>She, too, saw the tall, broad-shouldered
young man come into the court-room; she
even looked absently straight into his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
with her frightened stare. Then she looked
away.</p>

<p>"Stealing," Jacob Kalb was saying, "is
stealing."</p>

<p>The judge bent forward and spoke to
Jacob Kalb. William's character was, after
all, not the court's affair. If he had been
absent so long in Alaska, where the chances
were one to fifty against his life, he was
entirely negligible so far as the guardianship
of these children was concerned. But the
sudden vigor and vindictiveness of Jacob's
charge angered the judge. He did not like
the man's looks, and he did like Miss Miflin
and the quaint little Pennsylvania German
girls. He had seen Miss Miflin blush when
she mentioned the absent brother.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that this older brother
stole?" he asked plainly.</p>

<p>"He took school-board money, and didn't
pay it back."</p>

<p>Miss Miflin leaned forward.</p>

<p>"He was treasurer of the school-board,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
she said. "All his accounts were straight,
but his uncle, who succeeded him, claimed
that forty dollars in cash was missing. His
father paid it, and he has never had a chance
to explain. He does not even know that his
father and mother are dead. If he could&mdash;I
am sure he would be here. And his uncle
told people that he had stolen."</p>

<p>Her cheeks blazed, her hands clasped and
unclasped. Sarah watched her dumbly.</p>

<p>"And you think he is still alive?" asked
the judge kindly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, with quivering
lips.</p>

<p>"Do you think," began the judge again,
after a long pause. Then he got no further.
Little Sarah had risen from her chair. Her
shawl had slipped from her shoulders, she
looked with burning eyes across the room.
The judge thought that she was going to
fall, but she walked steadily across the open
space between him and the wide-eyed clerks,
toward the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sarah!" called Miss Miflin gently.</p>

<p>But Sarah did not stop. It was the judge
who saw the stranger first, and who guessed
the truth. Like a bird to its nest, she went,
and a strong arm gathered her straight
against the stranger's heart. Sarah did not
speak, she only hid her eyes against the
stranger's side.</p>

<p>The judge meant to look back at Miss
Miflin, and then he meant to dismiss the
court at once and banish all these impertinent
young clerks, and then he wanted to
talk to William. But his gaze stopped with
Daniel Swartz.</p>

<p>Daniel's embarrassment at having been
caught trying to bribe the twins had changed
to a more poignant emotion. He looked
frightened. The stranger's eyes were upon
him, also.</p>

<p>"I am William Wenner," said the young
man. "I have just come home. I did not
know that my father and mother were dead,
or that my little sister was in&mdash;in&mdash;such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
trouble. I wish that Jacob Kalb would say
again what he said."</p>

<p>Jacob Kalb lifted a determined face.</p>

<p>"I said that when you went away you
didn't pay back all the school-board money,
and your pop had to pay it, and you weren't
fit to be guardian of Sarah and Albert and
the zwillings,&mdash;that is what I said."</p>

<p>He did not heed the frantic nudging of
his master. He saw the Wenner house, which
he had so long coveted, slipping from his
grasp.</p>

<p>"Uncle Daniel&mdash;" It was a moment
before Uncle Daniel looked up. "Is this
true?"</p>

<p>"Well," began Uncle Daniel, in confusion.
"It was this way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Is it true?</i>" asked William again.</p>

<p>Now it was Jacob Kalb who nudged and
Uncle Daniel who paid no heed. He would
take advantage of any means to advance on
the path which he had set out for himself,
he could even deceive himself into believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
that he had done his best for the children,
he could cheat and slander the absent, but
here in the court-house, in the presence of
the judge, he could not lie.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. He looked like an
old man.</p>

<p>"Why did you accuse this young man
falsely?" asked the judge.</p>

<p>Uncle Daniel got upon his feet.</p>

<p>"I think I will go home," he said.
"William can be guardian if he wants to."</p>

<p>"No," said the judge. "You will not go
home. You will answer my question. Did
this young man owe the school-board forty
dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did he pay it to the school-board?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I have your receipt," said William.
"And Jacob Kalb was present when it was
paid."</p>

<p>"It ain't so," muttered Jacob Kalb.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Daniel's rage broke forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"He did give me forty dollars," he shouted.
"But he owed it to me before he owed it to
the school-board, for all the things I bought
him already. A couple of suits and hats and
candy and such a little velocipede and peanuts,
and I took him in the Fair; and then he
wasn't thankful. He wouldn't be adopted.
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So he paid you the forty dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But it was mine." Then Uncle
Daniel read in the faces of those about him
the first frank estimate of his character which
it had ever been his misfortune to see.</p>

<p>"I think I will go home," he said again.</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied the judge grimly. He
looked at William. "Do you want to prosecute
this gentleman?"</p>

<p>"No," answered William.</p>

<p>The judge saw that his lips were trembling.</p>

<p>"The court is adjourned," he said.</p>

<p>Then he changed his mind about lingering
to talk to William. He opened the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
into the ante-room, and shook hands with
them all.</p>

<p>"Make yourselves at home, and stay as
long as you like. I'm coming out to Spring
Grove to see you. And if you ever need a
friend, I'll do my best to help you. And
if&mdash;" he looked smilingly at William and Miss
Miflin, then he concluded that this was not
a time for joking. "God bless you," he said,
and was gone.</p>

<p>It was not until then that Sarah felt the
arm round her loosen its hold.</p>

<p>"He has Albert yet," she said. "I am
afraid he will do him something."</p>

<p>Whereupon the arm tightened its grasp
once more, and William had only one hand
to hold out to the amazed and delighted twins.</p>

<p>"Albert is all right," he said. "And
you're not to worry about anything, ever."</p>

<p>"And if it hadn't been for teacher&mdash;"
began Sarah.</p>

<p>"I know," said William. "And now we
will go home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Home!" The word was like a burst of
song. And only a few hours before she had
thought they would have no home. She took
a twin by either hand. "Come!"</p>

<p>But the twins drew back.</p>

<p>"We are going to walk by William," they
said together.</p>

<p>"All right," consented Sarah.</p>

<p>She and Miss Miflin led the way down the
broad steps, and William and the twins came
behind. They gazed at him rapturously,
realizing that he was as wonderful as their
vague remembrance pictured him.</p>

<p>"He is going," said Louisa Ellen, when
he drew his hand away, "to buy us candy!"</p>

<p>Fortunately it was to Sarah that he handed
the bag, and it was with Sarah that the
twins were anxious to sit when they got into
the train. It was a little trying that she
would let them have only two chocolate
drops apiece until they got home.</p>

<p>She looked back once at William and
Miss Miflin, who were not talking to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
other, but who smiled at her. There was
something in their faces which made her
heart beat.</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;" she said softly to herself;
then she did not finish the sentence.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am going to cook such a supper!"
she said to the approving twins. "First I
will fetch Albert and then I will cook."</p>

<p>But Albert did not need to be fetched.
When they opened the kitchen door, he ran
to meet them.</p>

<p>"Aunt 'Liza fetched me home," he cried,
"I am never going away."</p>

<p>There was the gentle closing of a door,
and a rustle of skirts, but Sarah did not hear.
Then she sniffed the air.</p>

<p>"I smell baked things," she said. Before
she finished, the twins were opening the
pantry door.</p>

<p>"Look here once!" cried Louisa Ellen.</p>

<p>"Aunt 'Liza's crullers!" said Sarah.
"And Aunt Mena's chocolate cake, five
layers, and bread and pies, and it is chicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
cooking on the stove, and I will make waffles
yet, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>William caught her by the shoulders as
she hurried from cupboard to stove.</p>

<p>"Here, youngster, not so fast!" This
was William, indeed, with all William's dear,
teasing, familiar ways! He looked at Miss
Miflin, and his voice shook. "She is just
like my mother. She&mdash;" But he could not
go on. Instead he stooped and kissed Sarah.</p>

<p>It was not until after supper that there
was time to talk; and then there was so
much to be said, that they sat at first
silently, except the twins, who, seated on
the settle with Albert between them, were
telling a fantastic tale of the day's adventures.
Sarah could hardly speak for happiness.
It seemed best to be quiet, and think,
and try to realize that they were all safe and
happy once more.</p>

<p>When William took Miss Miflin home,
Sarah put Albert and the twins to bed, and
told them all a story; then she went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>stairs
to wait until William came back.
Even then she must be busy. She took up
the sewing which she had laid down the day
Albert was taken away. It was finished by
the time that William opened the door.</p>

<p>He drew a chair up beside hers.</p>

<p>"Sarah," he said, "if a fairy came and
told you that you might have anything in
the world you wanted, what would you
choose?"</p>

<p>"I don't want anything but to stay here,"
said Sarah.</p>

<p>"Not if she said you might go to school?"</p>

<p>"To school?" gasped Sarah. "Ach, but
I am going to stay here and keep the house,
so that when you come home again&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarah was sure that William would not
stay in Spring Grove.</p>

<p>"Come home?" repeated William. "But
I am going to stay home. I am going to stay
here and farm, and the trolley is coming
almost to the door, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The slender tower of the main building of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the "Normal" came back into Sarah's field
of vision.</p>

<p>"Ach!" she cried. "Perhaps I could go
to the school, and ride on the trolley back
and forth, and keep house yet, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>William laughed.</p>

<p>"You shall go on the trolley back and
forth, all right, little Dutchman," he said.
"But you shall not keep house, yet."</p>

<p>"But who will keep house? It is always
so many things to do!"</p>

<p>"What would you think of teacher for
a housekeeper?"</p>

<p>"Teacher!" cried Sarah. "Miss Miflin?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Would teacher stay here with us?"</p>

<p>"She says so," answered William gravely.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
